,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hey mate, this might sound annoying or dumb but having been privately coached, and now doing some coaching my first tip would be work on your form closer to the hoop before you move out that far. You want to build good habits and a good shooting form first. Stand in the hot spot (just to either side of the hoop) and have the ball in your shooting hand. Form an L with your elbow facing the ground. Make sure you are using your fingertips to hold the ball, and it's not resting on your palm. Now, push that elbow up and I'm sure you know how to snap your wrist as a shot. Pretend there's a cookie jar on a shelf and you're trying to put your hand in it. I'd practice WITHOUT a guide hand until you're comfortable with that, don't even jump. Just stand somewhere close to the ring and practice that shot form. Choose a number and aim to make that many in a row, and then that many swishes in a row. You want the ball to get good arc and drop through the ring, not bounce around the sides. Once you've got that form down, put your non-dominent hand on the side of the ball and just use it as a guide. Once you've got that form down start to practice bending your knees. You'll want a foot slightly forward, on your shooting hand side. Just stand, bend your knees, then smoothly stand up and let the rhythm follow through into your shot. It should be one smooth motion of bend, into upright, into shot. Once you nail all of that practice and you're more comfortable with that, then I'd start moving out further. 

Watch some videos on guys like Duncan Robinson and Klay Thompson, they have an excellent stroke. 

Any questions feel free to DM me man, good luck!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It looks like you are getting good rotation on the ball and have a natural flick of the wrist, so that’s good.

I’d start by your left leg in, instead of kicking it out behind you. Your balance will be off if your shooting off one leg. 

Also I’d just practice keeping a higher release. You release the ball at nipple height when it’ll help your arc to release it a bit higher",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just make an L with your pointer finger and thumb and make sure you aren’t flicking with your left hand too,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shoot up not forwards your form is too easily blocked,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"try practicing getting the motion down so the dip, bringing the ball upwards with your body straight up to release. when i shoot i try to be as compact as possible so make sure on the way up your elbows are pretty close to your body not wide apart.

and i think its been said earlier but have ahigher release point because you are shooting from your chest area it seems. what works for me is when i feel im on my toes just about ima jump, the ball is right above close to my forehead and then i simply jump and release.

try what works out tho and as they have mentioned, practice closer so you develop good shooting habits",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IMHO, I think your form is like this because you dont have enough strength to shoot that far out and it causes you to push the ball forwards instead of upwards.
If I were you I would practice shooting with a normal form closer to rim and gradually increasing the distance.
Hope it helps. 💪💪",,,,,,,

Secondly I'm assuming you mostly do drills and practice shoots in the afternoon (?) What you can do is maybe keep a mattress or a thick blanket directly under the hoop so that noise is minimized. This way you can still practise your shooting without disturbing others.
As for dribbling practise you can't really do much and will probably have to time it in such a manner that you do it during more socially acceptable hours and in the afternoons you can focus on mobility, strength building, speed and your vertical jump.

A couple ways to do that is head to your local basketball court (i would say indoor over outdoor). Watch people play and then ask someone if they have a moment to give you some pointers or to critique your current abilities. 

If you're lucky you'll make a new friend or get some free drills from the experience.

2. One of the most important things in a game that you can do is study a person's shooting range, and how does their shooting change with different distances.
3. If you are defending against them, observe which side to they prefer WHEN you have pushed them to the outside i.e. stay close to them and guard more on the side closer to the basket, depending on whether they go from your better guarded side or from your lesser guarded side shows if they are willing to take risks or how big of a threat are you to them.
4. Every person has THAT one move which they love to use whether it be a dunk or a crossover.
5. Get the person on the edge if you are on offense or defense, their reaction would tell a lot.
6. People have a certain playstyle too, some lack in muscles and use speed while other just try to plow through you.
7. I know this is a different one, but try to steal the ball rather than blocking or stopping them.
8. Also pressurize and harass every person you attack or defend or defend. They get really easy to read when they are irritated.
9. I don't know why but using fakes and judging people's movements and reaction speed etc. might help you.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Watch NBA games and instead of only paying attention to the ball, pay attention to the players without the ball and look at what they do to get open. This will help you get a better understanding of the where your teammates should be standing when you pass to them, how long it takes them to get there, and how long you should keep your dribble alive for.
2. Pay attention to point guards who like to pass. Pay attention to their habits and why they keep doing the things they do. Watch for the type of passes they like to make most, how early or late they pass out of double teams, when they choose to score instead of pass and figure why they did them at those exact moments.
3. Learn about spacing and the types of motion offenses (5  out, 4-1, dribble drive etc). The best way to do this is to play on a team either at school/competitively or through watching basketball and playing 5 vs 5. These are basic sets teams run in 99% of leagues and they all have some similarities so when you learn one you can figure out the rest.
4. Play 5v5 /4 v4 as much as u can.",,,,,,,

Find an spot you like shooting from and just stand there and shoot, you’ll find it becomes easy. Form is super important of course too, look up YouTube videos on how to shoot and that should help.  
For me I found the best thing that improved my jumper was noticing how long pros keep their guide hand on the ball, all the way up until release.  Drills are good and you need them but you can improve without so much formality. 
Kyrie Irving said he didn’t really do drills as a kid, he just tried to pull off moves. 

However if your really set on a drill:
Start standing right in front of the basket, shoot and take a step back every time you don’t *swish* it. If you miss, go back to the start.

I had a terrible shot growing up I used to drive all the time.. I spent a couple years on my jumper and I shoot lights out I rarely drive now lol

YouTube different form tutorials but don't get too hung up on it eventually you'll find a way that feels smooth for you.. if you're serious get a trainer but not necessary (I didn't)

I've spent hours at a time by myself just spot up shooting, shooting off the bounce, simulating fade aways, shooting off screens, post moves, pump and counter etc... after two years my mid range game is lit",,,,,,,

I also reccommend this 12 variation mikan drill youtube video for good finishing around the rim. Research the role you want to play and the part they play on the court whether you want to be a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Power Forward Small Forward or Center. Also ik covid is rampant but playing against others like in 5v5 games is important although thats impossible for rn and never be afraid to play with others better than you and learn from them. Also try to emulate a player in the NBA that plays the same position as you and you want to have a similar play style to. Do you like Stephen Curry's off ball hustle and smart off the dribble shooting and catch and shoot style as a PG or Kyrie Irving's crafty and powerful ball on a string tight handles and his insane finishes around the rim as a PG, it's all up to YOU!!! Also watch player breakdowns for their defence and offensive styles, for defence I recommend Scottie Pippen, Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Kawhi Leonard",,,,,,,

I'm voting for hockey as there are so few colleges that offer hockey (there are only like 60 D1 hockey programs in the US vs 350+ D1  basketball programs) and it's not a head count sport, but I'm wondering if that is skewed because there is not a big pool of recruits available.

Leave the intimidation stuff alone or get ready for the prelude when you're intimidating some not-so-difficult-to-guard-looking-player and get your lunch delivered to you in front of everyone.

,Basketball,"Most people make fun of WNBA players, but don’t realize they are still professionals. These women have spent years being made fun of, working 3-4 hours per day for 20+ years, played at every level (and dominated) and will gladly 21-0 you if they had the chance. 

I played against one and I am only 5’11 and an 5’4 WNBA player stepped onto the court at a basketball camp in Brooklyn. We played and she barely lost. She was lighting fast, pulled from the logo and drained it easily. She was strong as hell and used her shoulders too push me back from the rim.

If you're talking purely in terms of skill I mean he probably was ""better"" than Jordan or at least on par. It was just a different era, Kobe played most of his career with zone defense being allowed and the illegal defense rule being abolished, I'm pretty sure zone defense became legal in the real early parts of the 2000's so Jordan pretty much played in a league where help couldn't come to defend his isolation on the post.

,Basketball,"I'm planning on buying a basketball rim to drill it up on the wall of my house,  just for casual shooting and all that in my backyard.. I've read some articles online and they say that regulation rims are 18 inches big, I DON'T want that because it feels way too big, I don't know if it's just me but I could've swore I've been practicing and playing on way smaller rims.

I'm deciding on either 14 or 16 inches big, at first I thought of 14 inches because my backyard doesn't go that far anyway and if it did, I would've picked the 18 inches and start practicing really deep shots, but unfortunately.. nope; and it's so I could take my mid-range game to the next level and start having tighter and more straighter shots so the next time I go outside, my shots are way more consistent.

But then I thought, wait.. if regulations are 18 inches, then wouldn't 14 inches be too small and too difficult then?

But the 16 inches look way too big for me too, it basically just feels like I'm cheating.

I'm not necessarily only going to use this for actual training and to become better but as well as to keep my shots fixed by doing casual shooting, so I don't want to have a hard time getting the ball in. 

So my question comes, Should I buy a 14 inch rim, 16 inch rim, or just stick with the regulation with 18 inch?

weaknesses- very very weak shooter, left hand finishing, shot iq, scoring consistency

I’m an average or a little above average basketball player with a lot if potential (as I’ve been told).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heres a few of my major strengths and weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;strengths - Fast, good ball handling ability, ability to move without ball, strong, decent finisher, student of the game, decent defender, good passer, good teammate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;weaknesses- very very weak shooter, left hand finishing, shot iq, scoring consistency &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i know I have time to work, and even started a YouTube channel and documentary series dedicated to just that (With 4 friends) How would you all Suggest I work on my game? I really don’t think that cone drills help, so none of those. I want consistent workouts that would actually help... advice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im projected to be 5’11 - 6’1 MAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a LOT or connections, and even some of my best friends are nba sons, but this is my journey. Not theirs. I know it’ll be tough since I can’t shoot, which is why getting a shot is my main goal. I also want to improve my scoring instinct because nothing in me really cares if scoring until the game is over and I regret only having 6-8 points &lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"I'm 16 (6ft) and have lost 20kg doing basketball drills and bodyweight plyometics in my back garden. (3 months now)

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

What can I do to reduce the noise?
I was thinking of removing the grass in my backyard and build a basketball court. (As i only have a 2mx10m space to play. 6ft6x10ft)
Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

I've been saving up for a backyard court for 6 months now and in another 6 I'll be able to afford it.

Untill then and after then what can I do to reduce the noise?

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" 🤷‍♂️ 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

Most think guards as perimeter players but players like Michael Jordan and Chris Paul thrive off of the mid range, it’s a risky shot but it’s easier for guards rather than forwards and centers, just get better at catching and shooting, shooting while being defended, and shooting off the dribble.

,Basketball,"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.

* 1: You can't just do a million calf raises

I watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.

*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire body

The few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.

* 3: Learn the proper form

If you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.

* 4: Start Low with a small ball

Now not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball

* 5: Dunk every day

This tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!

More practice isn't always good practice, if anything 5 hours is way too long. You'll end up taking low quality reps, you'll struggle to recover, and you'll increase the likelihood you get hurt.

You want to practice at game speed with good shooting form, with real shots. Learn the fundamentals: ball handling drills to develop a handle, how to read the floor and pass, defensive stance and how to move your feet, good help defence, rebounding, and develop touch with both hands

If you want to get extra work in, work on your body. Do sprint training, workout to get stronger, cardio. HIIT workouts, plyometrics resistance training etc are all effective at this",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Your upper body looks good. I would say widen your stance so your feet are shoulder width apart. I would also working on having your feet point to the basket. Hard to tell from the video without seeing the basket but it looks like your feet are pointed off to the side.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I’d widen your feet a bit. It might not impact your shot all that much but it’ll make you a threat to take it off the bounce.

However the most important part is that you should be comfortable in your shot while you are taking it, that is apart from your accuracy, probably the most important.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I fuck with it,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"College basketball player here - pretty good form for the most part. I would say hold your follow through more and the advice I give the most (and I can’t tell if you aren’t doing this) but your knees, elbow, and wrist should all snap at the same time, giving you a smooth consistent jumper",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Try to widen your base a little bit, place your feet so that they are closer to being aligned with your shoulders. There is no need to point your feet to the basket, that would actually hurt your form. Also try not to stop the lift of the ball and then push it hard, try to make the lift at a more constant rhythm, so that your release has a better energy transfer from your legs.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll be a little more critical than the other commenters. Up top, everything looks good. Pretty good elbow alignment and release. Down low your feet look they are too close together, which absolutely is an issue when it comes to balance. You also don't bend your knees very much on your shot meaning you are using a lot of arms. The power should come from your legs. You'll be able to shoot deeper that way as well.  Also these are very casual shots. You need to be shooting game speed type shots if you want a good critique. Simulate catching the ball on the hop and shooting with purpose. These shots here are just casual shootaround shots with very little energy. 

Knees bent, roll the ball to yourself, catch on the hop, shoot with purpose. It's hard to give good critique if you are shooting in a way that isn't how you shoot in a real game. 

I coached college basketball and high school basketball for 5 years and also played in college fwiw.

edit: Watching again you actually do bend your knees pretty well. Start with your knees already bent though, it'll make your jumpshot quicker.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Looks good not much to critique. Maybe spread legs apart more. Good use of legs and good follow through. I can’t see much wrong here. You could possibly have a higher release but you appear to be sorta tall so not much to worry about there.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Make sure to keep your elbow tucked and coming up in a straight line.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jumper looks pretty smooth. If you want to play at an elite level and possibly college I’d say maybe speed up the release a little bit but other than that it’s solid,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Looks good,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"square your feet to the basket and keep everything aligned through the entire motion, this will provide more accuracy and comfort while shooting",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It looks like you are bringing the ball in too low when you are pulling the ball up against you, just before you shoot it.  And the release point is low.  If you are average height or taller the ball probably should be a bit higher.  It is hard to tell much more about your form because the angle of the video looks to be a little from the side.  It would probably be better if you have one angle of the camera directly in front of you and in line with you and the basket.  Another angle from the side would be helpful as well.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm old school so I was always taught to have my shoulders squared to the basket. You have your elbow in and released at the top and followed through. So all in all good form minus the shoulders squared. If you look at some NBA players they don't have good for. Shawn Marion had one of the worst shots but still found a way to put the ball in the hole.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wider stance, Follow through and a bit higher of a release. It looks like you release it from your ear length in this.",,,,,,,

If I had to change one thing, it might be to part your legs just a bit more for slightly improved balance when shooting in motion.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it is pretty good but you jump to the side a bit every time which tends to bring you out of balance. make sure you jump straight up.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It’s a good form just shoot a lot. Everyone shots different so don’t worry if it looks different.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Looks good. We always can improve even if we’re highly skilled. Try loading your wrist. It’ll make it easier to get underneath the ball.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Don't listen to  people trying to change your stance. Its good. If you spread your feet more you will be shooting akward. Feet should be close. When you land your feet are together when you take off they should be together too. Look at Curry or Kyrie. Don't square to basket neither. You are supposed to be turned lil bit to the left  when you're shooting right hand. Look up Kyle Korver. Elite shooter that is square to the basketball every time. But what you'll notice is when he takes off he twists his body hard to the left when hes shooting. He does it to aline his shoulder with basket. Your shoulder should be pointing at the rim before jump not after. He does it because hes couches made him do it even if it's not correct way. You had many old school tips here that are just wrong and irrelevant nowadays.,,,,,,,

If you look at his average points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, etc throughout his career, they're incredible. Beyond that though he went 6-0 in the finals, without needing to go to a game seven. Basically, every single year he made it to the NBA finals, he won. Most times it wasn't close either. Another reason is that he stayed with one organization. He did play for the Wizards for two years, but that had to do with problems with Bulls' management. Every title he won was with the Bulls. He never left for another organization to chase a championship. You could literally go on for hours about all of his accomplishments. If you haven't already, I'd recommend watching ""The Last Dance"" documentary. It does a great job explaining the context behind all of Jordan's championships.",,,,,,,

,Basketball,"Hi,

I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:

* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? 

Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?

And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? 

* Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?

&lt;li&gt;What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with jerseys, I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s best - the home or away colors (although I&amp;#39;m guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I&amp;#39;m just overthinkng this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I&amp;#39;m afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don&amp;#39;t know much about this I&amp;#39;m worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I&amp;#39;m picking up an authentic item?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

You have to trust that your skills are good enough and let the body do it’s thing, if you constantly are overthinking and fearing messing up then you wont perform well it’s just as simple as that, basketball has such a small margin of error that when you experience tension you can’t play. Don’t stress it though everybody went through this stage, you are still at it late but you have a senior year left. But there’s a lot of people that are good when they aren’t under pressure but as soon as pressure comes they curl up in a ball and don’t want to do what they practice. I’m not sure how bad you want it but you have to take some serious steps to get through this, when I had your problem I just straight up worked so fucking hard because I was so tired of questioning my abilities. That’s basically the cure man, you have to work extremely hard to where you can trust your body when pressure comes and not let the mind take over. I would recommend giving mediation a try because that helped me a lot. Hopefully u take my advice because this is what I did, I’m now heading into my senior year with 3 D2 offers and D1 interest, so it’s possible, my freshman year I was in your shoes.

2. The Cavs have no reason to make that trade, they want to give the lkay tome at guard spots to give to sexton/garland and continue to hope they develop.
KLove isn't a center/TT is a free agent and drummond has a $28mil player option.
3. John collins just signed a max and his game is perfect to pair with trae AND they have capella. You can't play harrell and capella together anyway since they have the same strengths. 
4. You keep lou coming off the bench because his only value is his offense, if you start him, he gets hunted on defense on every possession. 
I agree with not trading PG for russ, that's a terrible trade and putting russ and pat bev is also a terrible idea, they hate each other. PG was a great player last year (as the first option) top 3 MVP and DPOY finish. He's a very good shooter as well in the regular season, remember he played as a SG in indiana before playing SF in OKC anyway so not an issue really??
5. This is really the key and I think all they need to do is run it back again but doc has to change his style of coaching and everyone needs to be given clear roles ans expectations. Kawhis the 1st option and PGs #2. Whenever lou wills on the floor he should be given the green light on offense and they should just let him put up as many shots as he wants. If he makes them then great, that's his job, if not pull him off ths floor and play someone that can actually defend and passes the ball. 

Mainly, the clippers need a real point guard who can control the flow of the game and they only had one on the roster who didn't get much time on the floor at all. If there should be any major rotation change, start reggie jackson and have him run the offense and set plays to get the ball to your main guys. Have pat bev come off the bench for him imo.",,,,,,,

3. Defense: coaches usually don’t cut players who can shut down an opponent. Be the player no one wants to be guarded by.

If he doesn’t remember you (maybe he doesn’t if it’s a large school with lots of players trying out) ask him what he looks for in general for the position you want to play. Make sure to keep it short and simple. Also, just fyi, the best way to make a team is to make shots. EVERY coach can use somebody who can make shots when they’re open.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think focusing on individual things is a good move right now. Worrying about ""playing well"" is a lot to think about at once, and it's hard to see improvement on a large scale like that.

What are you struggling with? For example, if you spend time every day working on your mid-range shots, you'll start to see small improvements. Once you're making these in-game, you'll get some of your confidence back and realize you can always keep improving in whatever area you focus on. 

It's also important to remember that during periods you feel like you're playing poorly, you can always hustle. Focus on playing good defense, working hard to get rebounds, setting screens, and communicating with your teammates. Be the guy/girl who sprints and dives for loose balls. Speed and conditioning will always give you an edge, so this could be a good time to get in good shape. Find a track and start doing [intervals](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19524240/run-faster-the-fun-way/) and do bodyweight workouts at home. Work on your vertical so you can jump for boards. This will always help. 

Otherwise, a lot of this sounds like confidence is the issue. Start talking yourself up more. Say things like: ""I put the hours of practice in, and now I'm going to play well."" I think working with a trainer or coach one on one could be helpful. I also really enjoyed the book [Stuff Good Players Should Know](https://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Good-Players-Should-Know/dp/0910305005). Hope this helps.",,,,,,,

You don't have Steph Curry's body, and therefore, shooting like him might not actually work the best for you. For me it took a lot of different forms to find one that actually worked. However, there are multiple things that you need, no matter what your body is like

Tilt your feet slightly away from your dominant side to loosen the tension on your lats.

Shoot with only your dominant hand propelling the ball and a strong flick of the wrist. Your wrist should be bent, with your hand pulled back towards yourself slightly.

Release the ball off of either your index or middle finger, or both. Your ring finger and thumb should not be the primary release finger

You should not feel like you are heaving or throwing it with your body. The wrist needs to be the main force.

Try to get some elevation on your shot. Don't hang in the air too long before releasing it, though. It's okay to release it before you get to the peak of your jump, just don't release it while you're still on the ground

Keep your shot motion fluid and smooth. There should be no (or not much) pause on the way up

Don't put too much arch on the shot, but give it a little.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"To be honest right off the bat, 3 days is nothing dude. Don’t worry about it. 

I commend you on the effort to change your shot to become more effective. It’s not easy to step outside your comfort zone and lower your ability in the short term so that you can break your previous ceiling in the long term. 3 days isn’t it though chief. People struggle after adjusting small aspects of their shot. You are completely changing it and everything that comes with it. Foot position, posture, hand placement etc, there are so many changes your body is making it is going to take time for it to feel comfortable and to see results. Don’t be discouraged now, don’t be discouraged in a month. Keep your focus and keep putting in the time required with purposeful reps. 

Best of luck dude!",,,,,,,

Also ik covid is rampant but playing against others like in 5v5 games is important although thats impossible for rn and never be afraid to play with others better than you and learn from them. Also try to emulate a player in the NBA that plays the same position as you and you want to have a similar play style to. Do you like Stephen Curry's off ball hustle and smart off the dribble shooting and catch and shoot style as a PG or Kyrie Irving's crafty and powerful ball on a string tight handles and his insane finishes around the rim as a PG, it's all up to YOU!!! Also watch player breakdowns for their defence and offensive styles, for defence I recommend Scottie Pippen, Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Kawhi Leonard",,,,,,,

Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!

Me - 5'10 - Can heat up and shoot from anywhere, also got a bit of a handle to beat defenders off the dribble with but not that physical.

My teammate - 5'9 - Big but not fast, can get a rebound and put it back up. Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)

Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.

Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.

1. Upornost, da treniraš kao konj, da daješ sve od sebe na svakom treningu, a ne da ih samo odrađuješ, posle svakog treninga da znaš da si dao sve od sebe i da si napredovao makar 0,0001%

2. Sreća ključni faktor, da radiš sa ljudima od kojih možeš dosta da naučiš, nije isto naučiti neke stvari sa 18 godina i sa 23 24. Generalno neko ko može da te usmeri u dobrom pravcu.

3. Zdravlje, naravno bez tela ne možeš ništa da radiš, slušaj svoje telo, odmaraj ga, kad treba. Povrede su najveći uzrok završetka karijera. Znam iz ličnog iskustva.

4. Ego, ne možemo svi biti Kobi i Jordan, jbg nekad moraš biti svestan da neke stvari koje su možda loše po tebe su dobre zw ekipu, nekad ćeš morati napraviti 5 faul da bi pobedio, biti spreman na žrtvovanje za ekipu, ali pošto cepaš odbranu kontam da to neće biti problem

5. Moraš da budeš svestan da prelazak iz mlađih kategorija u seniorsku košarku je razlika nebo zemlja, možda si u juniorima trpao 30 i nzm šta kad dođeš u seniore nije to to, nemoj tu da se razočaraš.

6. Prihvatanje neuspeha, moraš da budeš isto svestan da možda sav tvoj trud i napor i litre i litre prolivenog znoja krvi, možda na kraju neće ničemu doprineti.

I na kraju koliko te ima na košarkaškoj mapi, dal si reprezentacija, dal si u klubu koji se takmiči u aba ligi, prvoj hrvatskoj ligi?",,,,,,,

The positions are generally referred to as a number 1-5. The lower the number position a player is the better ball handling, shooting, and passing they have. But they're also smaller. The higher number position someone plays the better they are at posting up, shot blocking, and they're taller. So If you're a 1, you're taking the ball up the floor, you're a play maker, but you're small. If you're a 3, you can do a bit of everything. If you're a 5, you're playing in the post, and you're blocking shots, but you're probably the slowest.

 Here's a little guide to what different positions mean.
Point-playmaker
Guard-good handles
Shooting/stretch-good shooter
Forward-attacks the basket
Center/power-posts up

Usually, but not always, combining any two of those will tell you a position and what they're best at.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Point Guard- The best ball handler, playmaker, and generally the leader of the offense. The most important position. Job is to lead the team on both sides of the ball. Like a QB in football

Example: Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Chris Paul...


Shooting Guard- The best shooter/scorer. Job is to be a secondary ball handler, get buckets, and also help out on defense. 

Example: Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade

Small Forward- Most versatile position. The SF should be a balanced between scoring on offense and being a wing or on ball defender.  

Example: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard


Power Forward- a dying position. Back in the 80s-90s this was usually the best post scorer on the team . Now, it more of a mix between small forward, and center position. Shooting and Defense and usually the best attributes of the position.

Examples: Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tim Duncan (classic example) 

Center- the second most important position and most important position on defense. Usually the tallest and strongest, they use height to take away the easiest shot in basketball (paint shots), and modern centers are versatile enough to switch on to smaller and quicker guards.

Teammates of the free throw shooter must occupy the next adjacent spaces on each Only one of the third spaces may be occupied by an opponent of the free throw shooter. It is not mandatory that either of the third spaces be occupied by an opponent but may not be occupied by a teammate. If there is a discrepancy, teammates of the free throw shooter will occupy the spaces first.  Players occupying lane spaces may not extend themselves over their lane spaces in front of an opponent or be touching the lane line or floor inside the line when the ball is released by the shooter. They may not vacate their lane space more than 3’ from the lane line before the ball is released.  Players not occupying lane spaces must remain on the court behind the three point line above the free throw line extended and may not be touching the line or floor inside the line when the ball is released.""",,,,,,,

mm...

I got a few pointers

Faking-Do not overdo and in some scenarios, you don't even have to break down your defender.

Study your opposition before game or if that is not possible then study them while you are in the game. Pivot foot, shooting range, release time, special moves (ankle breakers,jumpers etc.), speed,agility,play style,strength,weakness,how to exploit them anything which gives your advantage.

If you cannot score much on offense, then become a better defense. Stealing a ball and charging front gives a good advantage.

As for dribbling, here are a few moves:-

The Dream Shake is a pretty simple yet effective move.

The normal stepback, but just shake up the defense a little bit before that you know?

Just try few floaters here and there.

Drive front near the basket but then suddenly but not too fast, allow the defender to catch up and then pull back as much as your shooting range allows.

Use both hands, do not depend on one.

Do some crossover, between both hands.

Right-Left-Right-Charge right and get a quick release in. (defender does not catch up)

\-Charge right, defender catches up, stop and pass the ball if no space.

Disguise passes as shots or shots as passes sometimes.

I get into the shooting position and shoot, but to the teammate instead of basket SOMETIMES.

Behind the back, between the legs.

Try altering your release time a bit to catch your defender off guard.

If you are being double-teamed then someone from your team must be free.

If you break through one defender and another reaches in, study the position of teammate before or during the play, pass the ball in any way (chest pass, behind the back, between defenders' legs or anything).Just get the ball inside the basket most efficiently.

Run for the ball when your team has it, run for the ball when your opponent has it. By this, I mean just stay in the same boat as the player with the ball.

When a player screens you, do not bother who did or how it happened. Sidestep and get where you have to be. Be on constant movement, keep your defender on the edge.

If you are playing against any opponent, and they are able to match you, always have that punch to be used in emergencies.

Stay near the ball or its handler but pl do not be a ball hog unless your teammates are bad.

Fadeaways can make good space but also work on behind the back, figure 8 dribbles, bullet passes. Anything which gives you the advantage, just do it (but play clean, unless your opponent is playing dirty then it is your choice just do no kill them.)

EDIT-Look at the opponent also not just the ball. Try to think how to make new plays when at home.

,Basketball,"Hey everyone, 
I'm  5'10-11/ 178-9cm 
15 years old 
And if it matters (hopefully not) Asian

So for the past 4months since April, I haven't got the chance to get back on the court. Hence, I decided to work on my athletism, running faster jumping higher etc.

My standing vert has increased by at least 4-6 inches and is at 27inches now. Same with my running vert at 32 inches. I didn't do any test on my running speed. 

My question is, how much more can I improve? 

Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.
Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.

Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new. 

Also any good cardio exercises that I can do indoors? And what exercise did u do that really pushed ur athletism to the next level?

You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Referee here. This is a good opportunity to talk about Legal Guarding Position. If you can obtain and maintain LGP, you can easily avoid being called for a foul. Here are some of the basic things to remember about LGP as it pertains to guarding a dribbler:

1. Every player is entitled to a spot on the playing court provided such player gets there first without illegally contacting an opponent.
2. A player who extends an arm, shoulder, hip, or leg into the path of an opponent is not considered to have LGP if contact occurs.
3. To obtain LGP, the guard must have both feet touching the playing court AND the guard's torso must be facing the opponent.
4. After LGP is obtained, the guard is not required to continue facing the dribbler. The guard is permitted to move backwards, obliquely, or laterally, but NOT forwards towards a dribbler that results in contact.
5. When guarding an opponent with the ball, no time or distance is required to obtain an initial guarding position. A dribbler should expect to be defended head on.

Given this, what matters is did you establish LGP before the contact occurred. If you didn't, and you're riding the dribbler shoulder to shoulder, this would be considered a blocking foul.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If both of you are moving and bumped into each other the fault will be on the defense even though ut may or may not be called a blocking.

To be safe the defender has to move slightly backwards so that the offense initiate contacts. Let the offense bump into your chest and hold your position they will get jammed up for an easy mistake.

It is always good to leave a small gap between you and the ball handler so the refs can clearly see who initated contact.",,,,,,,

Learning to use my left hand comfortably on layups, wide crossovers, etc. But I would never actually use them in-game. I'd always default to my most comfortable areas (shooting deep and step back fades.) You've just got to be okay with going for those things that you're uncomfortable with. Step in and shoot that mid-range shot with confidence. If you know that you're not quite where you want to be, follow your shot for a chance at the rebound. Over time, you'll start to obtain that muscle memory for what it feels like to shoot from certain spots and that in itself will increase your confidence. Good luck and have fun!",,,,,,,

The ball should be hitting the rim or going in every single time you shoot. Practice your mid range until you can hit the rim at least on EVERY SINGLE SHOT. Don’t worry about 3’s until you can do that. Jump shooting takes a hell of a lot of practice but you can get there with dedication. To give you some insight on how long it takes to get good at the jumshot: I started playing basketball at the age of 7. I wasn’t a “good” shooter until I was 20 years old. That’s 13 years! Be patient and just keep practicing your shot to ensure that your form is consistent and that you are focusing on every shot. You don’t ever want to just heave it up.

Try shooting for 1-2 hours every other day. You will see dramatic improvement even after a month of this, however it will take a lot longer to get “really good” at shooting.",,,,,,,

What I did was I consciously tried to shoot the ball higher, plus adding jump just before you release the ball. (This should be done in one motion) 

If you look at deep NBA three pointers the ball do have very curved trajectory and when it’s coming down to the ring it’s almost as if it’s falling vertically. Rarely it’s flat. 

If you shoot the ball flat you need to add significantly more power to increase its range and that could mess with your form.",,,,,,,

For example, maybe I want to improve my game out of triple threat position. So I will spin it to myself coming up to the wing, as if coming off a pin-down. Each time it will be catch -&gt; reverse pivot toward the middle of the floor.

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low and make a lay-up: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low and shoot a pull-up off one dribble: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; jab, crossover step -&gt; get to rim and finish: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; jab, crossover step -&gt; shoot a pull-up off one dribble: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low, jab, shoot a 3: 3 makes

Repeat on the other side of the floor going the other direction.

After doing this a couple sessions, I would add in more complex variations to the progression. Maybe a practicing a shimmy fake, maybe working on mid rips rather than low rips, maybe making my catch another 3 feet further out, or switching to working catch-&gt;reverse pivot-&gt;shot fake. Or outside pivot instead of reverse pivot.

I'm not saying this is the workout to do; this is just about one small aspect of the game. But this is the approach. Decide what you want to improve, specifically. Make a plan for the type of shots you want to shoot, and COUNT YOUR MAKES, not your attempts.

What you should not do if you are serious about being a ballplayer is show up, jack up some 3s and some fadeaways, try a fancy move you saw on TV, then call it a day.",,,,,,,

I’m in high school myself but I’ve been playing basketball since I was 4 or 5. Here are my overall tips (Sorry if it’s a lot). Learn the PROPER way to shoot fundamentally. Before you do anything learn how to shoot a basketball the right way. Shooting is something that if learned the right way early, can have a positive impact on your game. Many College athletes or even NBA level players go through multiple variations of their jumpshots because they never learned how to shoot the right way ( ex: Lonzo, Giannis, Fultz). I would focus on at least 100-500 makes a day using the fundamentals depending on how serious you are. The second thing you should focus on is your left hand, after you get shooting down learn how to shoot with your left hand. Your left hand can be used as a weapon and most people do not how to guard left handed shooters and dribblers. (Ex: James Harden, Zion, RJ Barret). After you learn the fundamentals of shooting learn the FUNDAMENTALS of dribbling. Do not start trying to be Kyrie with behind the backs, crossovers, step backs, learn how to dribble walking, jogging and running down the court and practice your change of speed. (Both left and right hand). After you really get dribbling down that’s when you can focus on the moves and combos just like in 2k. If you have a 65 Ball handling you cannot speed boost or equip elite dribble moves. Same goes for irl, you cannot do advanced moves with a bad ball handle. After you learn dribbling and shooting and become decent-good the rest comes with playing actual games (defense, rebounding, finishing). My final piece of advice is don’t let people get in your head and discourage you. On the court, people will always try to find a weakness both mentally and physically; do not let them take advantage of you and destroy your goals. I hope you got something useful out of this! Good luck!

A player is out of bounds when he/she touches the floor, or any object other than a player/person, on or outside a boundary. The ball is out of bounds when it touches or is touched by:

1. A player who is out of bounds.
2. Any other person, the floor, or any object on or outside a boundary.
3. The supports or back of the backboard.
4. The ceiling, overhead equipment, or supports.

**If a player has the ball in his hand and inbound touches someone out of bounds (ball not in contact with that someone), does it count as out of bound?**

No.

**What if the player touches a ref, opponent, bench (teammate/opponent/coach/spectators), if it is out of bounds which team gets possession?**

This is not an out of bounds violation. The player and not the ball touched the people out of bounds.

**What if a player out of bound touches the ball an inbound opponent is holding? If both were holding the ball it would be a jump ball situation but what if the out of bounds player merely touched the ball?**

This should be called an out of bounds violation on the team whose player was out of bounds. Even if grabbing the ball was instantaneous to touching, this could be advantageous to the team that was out of bounds if the alternating possession arrow is pointed to that team. We do not want to reward the team that was out of bounds.",,,,,,,

For me, confidence comes when I step into a gym and look around the place, and know that no one in there has put in as much work at this as I have. Maybe those guys are taller, those guys are more athletic, whatever. None of them have outworked me.

Try not to worry about outcomes, just see each game you play in as a learning opportunity and an opportunity to grow. You need reps and reps of situations to feel comfortable and confident in those situations. That just takes time and being in game situations.",,,,,,,

I make most of my open 3s but I shoot wide open on a hoop on my street. I don’t think I’m incredible at handling the ball, I can’t jump to save my life, 15 inch vert I think, I don’t really have a left hand but I’m good at finishing around the rim, I go as hard as I can every possession including defense which I think I’m good at. I haven’t really practiced basketball so things like ball handling and shooting I can get better at because I’m a very very hard worker, like I work 3-5 hours a day in baseball and I’m probably gonna go d1 for baseball. I’m really debating trying out but I’m worried I’m not good enough&lt;/p&gt;

You probably have some movement patterns (you mentioned landing, that could be part of it) that are putting unnecessary stress and strain on various parts of your knee. Over time, this will lead to pain, swelling, tendonitis, other overuse injuries, and increases risk of acute injury (e.g. ACL tear).

If you want to get back in the game, your best bet is probably to see a physical therapist and describe your situation. They can put your through a mobility screening and recommend corrective exercises that could address mobility limitations, strength imbalances, improper movement patterns, etc.

Tesla shoes are like $30 on Amazon, but they wear out pretty quickly. Make sure you land on your forefoot when you run with them, if you decide to give it a shot. That shock from a heel-first gait is pretty rough.

Do loosening or tightening the laces make a difference?",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has a lot to do with the cushioning.

1a. The midsole foam is a buffer that impedes sensory feedback from the ground to your soles. You're literally less in touch with the ground;

1b. The inherent instabilities of standing on an elevated and mushy midsole structure means that instead of using all your muscles to push off, they also have to perform an additional task of adjusting for balance;

2. When exerting downward forces to push off, the cushioning foam absorbs and wastes some of the force, i.e. it cushions;

3. varying on your shoe size &amp; type, your pair is adding 0.5-1.5kg in mass.

4. It's obvious that the fit or cut of a shoe can affect the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of one's foot. Wearing shoes may be negatively affecting your optimal jumping mechanics.

All the above factors when combined can explain why you're experiencing a significant reduction in your vertical. It's worth noting that [NBA players generally appear to prefer less-cushioned &amp; lighter shoes to maximalist &amp; clunkier alternatives](https://i.redd.it/hw5q0bfownl51.png).",,,,,,,

,Basketball," So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it. 
 So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand. 

 I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:

1. I'm too weak

2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball

3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens

4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or hand

There's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.
I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release. 
 Oh, also, if any of you have any tips for my guide hand, then please tell me!

The NCAA, in just one year of issuing new flop rules, has handled it better in-game. They issue a warning similar to delay of game if they judge an action to be flopping. The second offense by anyone on the same team is a class B technical foul. I saw this process called multiple times this year.

As for arguing, it wasn't that long ago that the NBA had a zero tolerance policy on any negative reactions towards referees. It was an automatic technical foul. And it SUCKED to watch. It should be up to the referees to manage the game and set the tone over what they will tolerate. ""I understand where you're coming from, here's how I saw it."" ""Coach, we can answer your questions, but I can't address commentary on every play. We have to move on.""

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have a pretty killer stepback and am pretty good at changing directions to get to the rack (can't dunk either, but am tall and can grab rim). My advice would be a warmup drill i do which involves doing a stepback and landing on one foot. Really any single leg hopping is great for basketball, focusing on landing with good mechanics (stick landing, keep knee from caving in a valgus direction, absorb shock to land softly with your glutes and quads). The diagonal stepback move (with or without ball, I do it with a ball when warming up) landing on one leg is a particularly good one to train the deceleration during a stepback 3 where you need to gather your balance quickly and be able to rise up for the shot in rhythm.

A good dribble drive move you can practice to work on functional acceleration is a pullback and go. Basically if driving to the right from near the perimeter, do a hard pullback crossover R to L (either low and tight in front, under right leg, or behind the back if your handles are elite) as if going left or stepping back, then cross L to R and drive hard to the right right past them. Once you have them to the side of you, either go into their body to finish hard off the backboard on the right, do an underhanded reverse finish on left, or kick out to corner if you need to. You can add something else quickly during the pullback to freeze them like a head fake (if executed properly at full speed, your center of mass naturally rising during the hard pullback will trick them enough so you can get a partial blow-by without needing anything else),. Just be careful not to expose the ball too much (particularly during the second cross) so you don't turn it over.

Just a couple ideas that have worked for me, Idk your skillset though. What do you like to do offensively?",,,,,,,

If someone's a great shooter, but isn't particularly fast, they'll be gaurded very close (think james harden). If someone's fast, or a powerful driver, but can't shoot, the defender is willing to give them more space (think giannis). Basketball is also a team sport, so when defending you also have to think about things like denying passes, and playing help defence. A lot of NBA teams will also make it part of their offence to switch a bad defender onto a great scorer. So if you're playing someone 1 on 1, and you know how they play, it's usually not too hard to atleast contest their shots. If you're playing 5 on 5, there's a lot of other factors besides just standing between them and the basket, that makes it a lot harder.",,,,,,,

,Basketball,"Hi,

I got into basketball recently and I'd love to get a book with plenty of images (preferably photos but illustrations are cool too).

I am not interested on the history of the sport or biographies of players. I am looking for a book that shows the essential moves, gives advices on exercises to improve, etc. 

I would particularly love player movements broken down in sequential images.

I searched on the internet and found something that is close, it is titled basketball anatomy, the illustrations shows key muscle groups and stuff, but it is more focused on strength training for basketball players. So it looks not bad, bad too niche.

I wonder if basketball for dummies would fit my expectations.

At every other level, including most pick up games, you only get one step. So most euro steps, or step backs you see in the NBA would be a travel anywhere else. You can get around this a little, by altering when you pick up your dribble. You don't actually get your one step when you dribble, but actually when you pick up your dribble. So you can pick up your dribble later than you normally would, and your first step turns into your zero step. In your case, if you use your step then pump fake, you need to make sure your foot doesn't slide after you plant it, and when you jump, you need to jump either off your pivot foot, or both feet. So if you use your step, come to a stop on your left foot, you can't then fade away off your right foot.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I recommend looking at u/CJ_Champion and his posts, he has one of the best styles in the dunk game. Pay attention at how his legs move when he dunks. They flutter around which help to make the dunk look more fulfilling. It makes him look like even after he is jumping he still is continuing to use his legs. Another way he makes his dunks look good is that he uses his head and arms to accentuate his dunk. After the ball goes in his arms and head flail around as if there is recoil to his dunks. This makes his dunks seem more powerful as if they were an explosion. So in conclusion just move your legs around while in the air and sell the dunk with your body by moving it even after it is finished. Also feel free to check and ask around in r/ProDunking for more info. I hope that helps :)",,,,,,,

If you are serious, I would try to hire an agent who could put you in contact with teams looking to fill roster spots. You are not going to play in Spain's top league straight away, coming from where you're coming from. You will probably have to prove yourself in lower divisions and less prestigious leagues.

I know of 2 guys that were playing overseas and are out of jobs due to covid. The competition for foreign roster spots is going to be too high for someone like you right now.

I would also heavily recommend you exhaust your college eligibility and try to transfer to a D1 school. No offense, but putting up stats on some random D2 team does not prove you can hang with elite talent and you need to try to prove this to not only quality agents, but potential pro teams. 

So my advice would be to transfer to a D1 school, exhaust your eligibility, hire an agent, and go from there.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ok i have played for several years in Spain in LEB Oro (2nd division). To put it bluntly it is really, really, really hard to get an ACB job as an American without any NBA experience (either NBA, G-League, or summer league). The last time I checked, of the around 90 Americans that had played in the ACB in the last 4 years, only 3 or 4 of them had zero NBA experience. It is possible but it is difficult. Even having a tryout with an NBA team to put on your resume helps a lot. 

As far as playing in Oro, Plata, or EBA, this year will be difficult for that as well. Oro is not sure the format of their league due to COVID and a lot of their rosters are full at the current time. Plata has even less security, and EBA even less than that. The Spanish Basketball Federation (FEB) is trying to control it as well as they can but they are being pretty indecisive right now. During other years, those leagues are great ways to get your name into Spanish basketball and work your way up from there. Your character will go far in Spain. If you are good teammate and have talent, other teams will take an interest in you. If you are a problem on the team, the coaches and GM's will talk and it will be difficult for you to find work. Side note; the money is not great in any of those leagues but the cost of living is so cheap in Spain, you can get by pretty easily. 

If you have any other specific questions about Spanish basketball, feel free to message me.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are a few paths...

1. Do a post grad year at a prep school with a reputable basketball program. They may be more well known by college recruiters than your high school, so they may give you more clout. You also won't use any of your college eligibility so you can still play four years in college.
2. Go to a Junior College. JUCOs are probably even more visible than prep schools and probably more talented, too. You will use a year or two of your four year college eligibility, but as long as you are a good student, you will earn college credit and will earn a bachelor's degree at a younger age than if you go to prep school.
3. Take one of your D2 offers and ball. You might find you like the school and wish to stay. Or you could enter the transfer portal and see what D1 attention comes your way. The kid who led all D2 freshmen in scoring last year did this and got like 10 D1 offers immediately. The downside is you will use one of your eligibility years while at the D2 and you will have to sit out from games for one year while at the D1 school (you don't use any eligibility during your sit-out year). Sucks to have to sit, but you still get to practice and you could end up graduating before your eligibility is over. This would allow you the freedom to transfer to a different school without sitting or stay at your D1 and get a year of grad school for free.",,,,,,,

It's what I did when I started taking basketball a bit more seriously when I was 17. It's also kinda hard to describe what you should be doing through text and a video to actually watch and observe will always be more effective.

At least in terms of training to be physically better at basketball, weighted leg training (squats, calf raises, straight leg deadlifts and hip thrusts for example) plus plyometrics (box jumps, squat jumps, split jumps, depth jumps, any sort of jumping) will help you increase your vertical and explosiveness which is always going to be extremely beneficial for playing basketball. Sprints are also very handy in increasing one's explosiveness and translate well to the basketball court as you'll be sprinting up and down the court during games.

Also watch a bunch of tutorial videos online explaining the proper shooting mechanics. If you haven't played basketball before you're very likely going to have a broken jumpshot that could use some smoothing out in certain areas. Something I've done for myself a couple times is record my self shooting and analyse where it could be fixed. Other than that, practice makes perfect so good luck bro",,,,,,,

,Basketball,"A poem i composed about my love for Basketball.

I walk into the court full of lights,

The fans on their feet all buzzing with joy,

My family waving with smiles,

I'm glad they've seen who I've become.

The ball is passed to me &amp; i dribble onward,

A screen to the left &amp; I shoot,

A 3 pointer &amp; i'm now in the zone,

A bit of fouls &amp; timeouts used,

The game moves on.

I'm glad they accepted me &amp; encouraged me to be better,

With endless days of sweating &amp; training,

we are proud of we've become &amp; now bonded by ball,

with trust &amp; love, we move on as family &amp; as one we ball.

Dunks &amp; shots fill the court,

layups &amp; 3's scores the point,

a pass to my mate &amp; the clock tic tocks,

with head up high the court is scanned,

I'm free, he passes &amp; this is it,

scared of ending the game is who i am,

With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,

 A 3 point shot &amp; the game we win.

With smile &amp; joy we celebrate our win,

Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.

&lt;p&gt;A bit of fouls &amp;amp; timeouts used,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look around &amp;amp; see my teammates  I&amp;#39;ve played with,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad they accepted me &amp;amp; encouraged me to be better,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With endless days of sweating &amp;amp; training,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we are proud of we&amp;#39;ve become &amp;amp; now bonded by ball,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with trust &amp;amp; love, we move on as family &amp;amp; as one we ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunks &amp;amp; shots fill the court,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;layups &amp;amp; 3&amp;#39;s scores the point,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a pass to my mate &amp;amp; the clock tic tocks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with head up high the court is scanned,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m free, he passes &amp;amp; this is it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scared of ending the game is who i am,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 3 point shot &amp;amp; the game we win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With smile &amp;amp; joy we celebrate our win,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I open my eyes with a smile &amp;amp; realize it&amp;#39;s all dream,&lt;/p&gt;

I can do just about everything else fine on the court but this, especially when my shots not dropping and my confidence is low I’ll literally just force a shot over my defender or pass it back. I have been practicing a strong dribble and pull-up but need much better ball handling in order to even take 2 strong dribbles. I’m above average height and feel like with my shooting the defender has to step way up and take my pump fakes seriously but I’m so far behind in my dribbling and driving that I feel like a fool sometimes. I’m also not that fast with the ball which hurts my confidence, but even my friends who aren’t that fast can get it done too so I know it’s not that big of a deal

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A simple effective move I go to nearly everytime when being closely guarded in pickup or 1v1 is a jab step. Sometimes I'll jab step right and then explode left to drive to the basket. I'm decently athletic so that does help my explosion, but if your defender is playing real close to you because of your shooting ability, then you should have an easier time being able to get past them when they're not expecting a drive.

However you obviously can't get away with the exact same move everytime so I do mix it up. I might jab step right, hesitate like I'm about to dribble left, but then explode right. Another variation is jab stepping right, one dribble left, and then step back for the shot as I'll usually have enough space at that point. That combination is very effective as it means you're stepping back into a rhythm shot if you're right-handed. If you're a lefty then you can do the same combination of moves but the sides reversed.

Another jab step variation I use (and forgive me if my explanation isn't very clear), is  to basically turn around on my left pivot foot, with my back facing the defender, before either jab stepping with my right foot to my left side and then exploding right, or just simply exploding to the ring on my left side. I saw Fred van vleet do that move in a pickup game on you tube and it looked simple enough so I decided to add it to my repertoire. 

Honestly I'd recommend just watching NBA players play 1 on 1 pickup games, as you get a chance to really watch their footwork and how they create space. hopefully my explanations made sense for ya.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am a shooter too and I know exactly what you mean about freezing. One very important thing to do is to keep your defender guessing. If you keep shooting over him or passing back he knows what to expect and will close out on you every time. So next time you get the ball maybe do an immediate drive to the basket or a quick pass and try to think about what your going to do before you even get the basketball. You should search up ball handling drills on youtube. Now you could also focus very heavily on your shooting like a Kyle Korver esk player. Go on youtube and watch how magnificent Steph Curry is at off ball offence (that means constantly running around the court to be open. Another huge thing which will help your game is to remember, SHOOTERS SHOOT.  Even if your shot isn't dropping keep shooting that if you have an open shot. Hope this helps, let me know if you need to know anything else. (you don't need to be fast, just need to be quick).",,,,,,,

If you're a decent shooter already, all it takes is like 30 minutes on the new rim to get used to it. Shooting on a rim that's not 10ft won't screw your shot forever.  
  
Edit: NBA players have shot millions of times on 10ft and believe me, you can't beat those mfers at one of those pop-a-shot rims

It generally wasn’t much of an issue and I succeeded as a shooter for years at my particular level. 

If you’ve got a choice between 10 foot rim and one higher than 10, I’d pick the 10 foot rim every time. But if the higher-than-10 is all you have access to, that’s going to be better than not playing any basketball at all. Yes, there will be adjustments when you get back to 10, but those adjustments are often overstated.

The way I look at it, most of my basketball outside of official games or leagues features tons of ever-changing variables. Cheap basketballs, imperfect rim height, wind, double rims, springy floors, etc. If I only held out for the perfect conditions, I wouldn’t have become nearly the player I am.

Edit: I just read another one of your comments stating that you’re working on an 11-foot rim?! That’s a bit more dramatic than I was imagining and I’d thus not recommend. You can get away with slight variability, but that’s not slight.",,,,,,,

Personally I think it’s best to practice on a 10ft rim if it’s the rim you’re going to practice on consistently since you don’t want your shot altered in any way. One summer I worked on my shot outdoors on my rim and I didn’t realize that it was slightly low the whole time. When I finally got access to an indoor gym after months of grinding my shot was broke asf and it took me a while to adjust back. I’m sure it’s the same for a rim that’s high. On the other hand, not every rim even indoors is perfectly 10ft so being able to adjust and get buckets on rims that are slightly off is important too.",,,,,,,

,Basketball,"My best guess is that by jumping before shooting they can focus more on the horizontal distance the ball travels rather than how high it goes, but surely it's more beneficial to combine arms with legs? 

There are many players who do this, so it would make more sense to give examples of those who don't, like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard.

As for me, I prefer to shoot while jumping as opposed to after jumping, as I always seem to undershoot when I  do the latter.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Just thinking off the top of my head for my 2¢ worth.  Catching and shooting in one motion is one of the most delicate things in basketball.  Delicate because you normally have to catch the ball softly.  You need a near perfect pass and you need space to get the shot off (not a ton of space but more than normal).  Catching the ball softly, as opposed to catching with authority, means you need the space or otherwise the defense can knock the ball out of your hands easier.  This problem is multiplied because most catch and shoots are less lift off the floor.  Catch and shoots also require near perfect timing.  Also lots of players prefer the timing mechanisms of stepping into their shot.

In all, if you catch and attempt to shoot in one motion with the defender closer than required - you have a soft catch and come off the floor less, so the defender has an easier time and can get a shooter stuck in the air with the only remaining option to pass and the shooter has less time so fewer options to recover.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It used to be that players would release as they started to jump. Then it was found that it's more efficient to release at the peak of your jump. I'd assume it has something to do with being harder to block, and giving you more time to adjust before the release. I imagine it also helps the angle you shoot the ball. I forget what the angle is, I want to say it's either 45 or 55 degrees, but there is an advantage to having the ball descend at the right angle. Releasing higher probably helps with that.",,,,,,,

Drew Hanlen has a nice 3-key breakdown of ""shiftiness"": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSS1Q9yFRJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSS1Q9yFRJg)

With that said, I too love watching McCullum's game, and I think his style doesn't just come from handles and moves, he's really good at reading the defender's momentum and then reacting by either changing direction or speed, often using really basic moves. That's probably something that can only be learned by playing a lot.

(wild guess: CJ does seem to play lower and wider than most players, so maybe that could be a key to his movements? Maybe strengthening the core/increase hip mobility to allow you to get lower?)",,,,,,,

As fatigue sets in, the quality of your repetitions will start to degrade, which could lead to ingraining bad habits. You also are more susceptible to injury.

You also need adequate recovery. Occasional rest days and ""light"" days are important to avoid repetitive-use injuries and to reduce risk of acute injuries.

I think what you described, 1 hour skill work, 1 hour weight training, is probably the most I'd recommend for young players. I'd do weight training only every other day. Skill work daily, 90 minutes on days with no weights. 1-2 rest days per week with no intense activity at all.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dunking is way different than jumping. It’s not in your head like others are saying. There’s a lot of biomechanics that go into maximizing your vertical and it’s hard to maintain grip on the ball without losing momentum on your arm swing.

You can try cupping the ball or swinging the ball across your body. You can train by doing plyometrics and grip strength exercises. PJPerformance has some great videos on IG you can check out. Good luck 👊",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,its how atletic you are some have high hops some dont you can go to the gym to train it some but everyone has a cap on how high they can jump and for some its just less,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It could be a myriad of reasons but the biggest that I can think of is that jumping high and dunking are NOT the same thing. Similar, but not identical. Dunking is a very specific skill that requires coordination, ball control, body control, explosiveness, timing, and positioning ON TOP OF jumping high enough to actually do it. Dunking is a skill, and like all skills, must be trained. Here's what I would do. Firstly find a ten foot hoop:

Run and jump and see if you can grab rim. Can you do it with both hands? This may sound silly to you but practicing your form and run up help immensely and assure you're not overestimating your abilities.

Then I would try this dunk progression provided you can grab rim, two hands, 9 out of 10 times: golf ball, tennis ball, mini basketball (like for indoor hoops above doors), volleyball, soccer ball, women's basketball, deflated basketball, regulation ball. If you're not dunking yet, you will get stuck on one of these before you hit regulation. Which ever one you're stuck on, keep practicing it until you can do it 9/10 times. The reason? You're not training to jump high. You're training to dunk. No one jumps their highest WITH the ball, but you can train to make this difference as small as possible. 

Simply put, you simply have the athleticism if your post is accurate about your vertical but lack the skill. Luckily for you, it is MUCH easier to train the skill than train the athleticism and requires a lot less time. Good luck bro. You'll be dunking in no time!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ive jumped up and grabbed rim w both hands but only on days I feel good about my hops. It’s the adrenaline in game that gives me that boost to jump higher and I also think it’s the motion. When I go up for blocks and rebounds I would say I use a springing motion that shoots me up. When the ball is in my hands i never do that motion tho and I’m usually not as motivated as I am for a block or rebound,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Don’t think about jumping when you dunk just go up and do it. I know that sounds weird but I got my first dunk in game on accident. I was going up for a tip in and just jumped up for the rebound, grabbed the ball, noticed I was high enough and just dunked it. Try not to put too much thought into the dunk/jump itself and worry about your defenders or something. This might be really unorthodox but it helps me so may as well put it out there",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Your timing is probably off. When you rebound, you're putting yourself in the way of the ball so you only need to worry about your body in two dimensions of space+time. When you need to actively move yourself to the hoop, you're dealing with three dimensions+time. Just takes practice to get the muscle memory and timing right.

Roughly. I know you move a little bit to the ball, but it's nothing like trying to get to the hoop",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe it's the weight of the ball holding you down? I know it's only 29.5 ounces, but that can still make a difference",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Are you jumping off one foot or two when you try and dunk? How does that differ from you blocking a shot or rebounding? Also like an above comment said it might be mental. I know there where times I tried to dunk but wasn't successful. Bit there where a few times I didn't think about anything and I dunked off a rebound a few times. It was like an instinct.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"dont think of dunking it, think of slamming it on top of the backboard",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re getting your elbow over rim you would be able to dunk easily. For me i used to slways throw the ball. Once your hand is over the rim, just drop it in the hoop dont throw it st the back of the rim or the backboard",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You gotta work to increase your vertical,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lol Im 6'1 and can barely touch the rim. Consider yourself lucky you can jump like that.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean anyone about 6 foot won’t always be able to dunk, dunking requires practice and training no matter what height you are (unless you’re like 7 foot). 

The reason you mentioned can be explained by three things. 

Firstly, when going for a dunk off the dribble, you use less arm swing, and that will reduce your vertical if you don’t know how to swing up with the back.

Secondly, you have adrenaline when in game. Going for a rebound or put back dunk in game will always be easier as your CNS is firing quicker and you have that desire to get up. You’ll be running quicker, jumping quicker e.t.c. Which leads quite nicely to...

The third reason. You might not be jumping high enough. People on the ground will obviously think you jump higher than you actually do because of the angle. Maybe they think you’re getting a whole hand above the rim but in actuality it’s only half that. 



Now, how to fix this? Allocate time for “dunk/vertical” sessions. Get to the court, warm up PROPERLY, play a game of pickup/one on one and go hard. When that adrenaline is flowing you can feel it, you want to expend that energy. Now stop playing and go for a jump without the ball. Only think about one key element of the jump, forget all else. For me it’s focusing on the last two steps. Really go for it, try and touch as high as possible on the rim. If possible get someone to record you doing it. Then you can reflect and see how to improve your technique, and if you actually are jumping high enough to dunk.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't dunk myself, even if I'm over 6 feet, but one thing I know for sure - you have to practice dunking. A smaller ball, ball gripping and what not. You have to know how to put the ball in to the hoop in a short period of time. As every skill it takes practice. Good luck!",,,,,,,

Who you know can help. Put in effort to talk and engage with coaches when you try out for national teams. Talk to pro players that have gone to college in the states or have had pro careers around the world. The community at the top of world basketball is relatively small, lots of people know lots of people and connections can be the reason scouts show up to your games.

Your first goal should be D1 college basketball in the USA.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ok so, according to a respected paper written, 2% of body fat loss(depends on how much your current weight it can vary in measureable weight 3-6lbs )  can lead to about 2-4 inches in max vert. 

For me if I went from 30 to 10% body fat from a 193lb 5'10 body I would be 155-160lbs and so in theory  and rough estimates I could have a gain of atleast 15 inches which for me would be atleast 31inch max vert which is almost dunking level. 

On a thought here - this will apply to muscle weight as well,  if you are *just*  trying to increase vertical- you don't need needlessly  large bicep and chest muscles. Huge quads don't mean huge vert gains, you also need to work other half of the legs like the glutes and hammies.

This may have nothing to do you your situation but if you’ve ever found yourself getting tired or annoyed with either one of them I’d choose the one that hasn’t annoyed you...if that makes sense.

According to a dunk calculator, you have a vertical of 28 which isn't bad at all. Most NCAA D1 basketball players hover from the late 20's to early 30's in vertical, however, you do not possess a 34 inch vertical in which case you could dunk. That's still quite a ways to go. The good news is you're still young and can grow and can more easily put on muscle and shed weight. I recommend improving your leg strength till you can squat 2× body weight then switching to explosive plyometric exercises. Of course you should also jump as much and as high as possible. Pertaining to your vertical potential, no one can really know. Some guys like Chris Paul and AI could/can leap out the gym and they've never really worked vert to my knowledge. The rest of us normy folk have to train rather intensely for what they were born with. It's also worth noting that goals matter. Do you just want to be able to dunk on the fastbreak or do you want to posterize people? These are very different goals, and at 5'9 and 16 years of age, height doesn't appear to be in your cards. This doesn't mean you couldn't have the miraculous growth spurt but I'm 6 feet and 20 and still waiting haha. Dunking is cool and by all means work on it, but it won't necessarily make you a better basketball player (I could dunk at 5'8 when I was 15). That being said, I wish you the best of luck and want you to jump out of the gym someday. Good luck man.",,,,,,,

Passing behind the back and dribbling will change your game if you can understand when to use it.

When a PF gets the ball, he should already be in a position to either take the shot or dish it out, not move with the ball.   


Of course, this does not apply in all scenarios, but, in my experience as a PF, the only time I ever ran the ball was to drive or pass, and usually never more than 13ft since big men usually need to get to the other side and set up the pattern first. There are also scenarios where you might be forced to bring the ball since both guards are locked up, but, in my opinion, these scenarios are few and far between and are not worth counting on.   


On the other hand, learning how to dribble will help you move more fluidly and give you more space to do your job.   


As you mentioned, you've only been playing basketball for 2 years, it's still too early for you to think about being satisfied. Besides, as a Power Forward, dribbling shouldn't be your standard, focus on your game under the post, rebounding, court vision, passing, and setting up screens.",,,,,,,

You don't need anything except maybe a basket. The only two materialistic things in basketball you need are a basketball and a basketball. Everything after that is an accessory. Look at Caron Butler, there is your example. If you cannot find a basket, then practice dribbling.

&gt;3. I have very bad social skills so I couldn’t make any friends while playing basketball. 

Same thing with me, except I have good social skills and friends but whenever it comes to supporting me, they always disappear. The greatest friends you can have on a basketball court are the basket,the ball and yourself. Everyone after that is meh.

&gt; 4. I can’t even go to local basketball court because every alcoholic and bad people are there nearby and I just hate the place (not to mention it’s always full with children). 

There must be a time in the morning or at night when no one is there. Use that to your full advantage. Let's suppose it is only free during your time in school/work/any non-weekend day.

Then practice dribbling during other days and shooting during those free days.

1 is the point guard, there job is to bring the ball up the court. They're usually the best ball handler, and are generally the play makers. They also are usually one of the best long distance shooters, but not always.

2 is the shooting guard, as the name suggests, they're usually the best shooter. They can put the ball on the floor if they need, but usually play more catch and shoot.

3 is the small forward. They're usually the all around player who can do a bit of everything. Most of their points will come from driving to the basket.

4 is the power forward. They can post up if they need to, but will primarily score from driving still.

5 is the center. They will usually play with their back to the basket, and post up their defender. They'll often also get most of their team's rebounds, and are in charge of cleaning up any shots their teammates miss.

Usually if you're smaller and quicker, you'll play a 1or 2. If you're taller, but maybe pretty lanky, you'll play a 3 or 4. If you're the tallest, and strongest, you'll play a 5.

Those are the traditional positions, but nowadays there are some other, unofficial ones, like ""point forward"" or ""stretch 5"". You don't really need to understand those if you're just a casual fan.",,,,,,,

I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.

I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!

Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.

It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.

Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.

I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.

TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3.

I got a few pointers

Faking-Do not overdo and in some scenarios, you don't even have to break down your defender.

Study your opposition before game or if that is not possible then study them while you are in the game. Pivot foot, shooting range, release time, special moves (ankle breakers,jumpers etc.), speed,agility,play style,strength,weakness,how to exploit them anything which gives your advantage.

If you cannot score much on offense, then become a better defense. Stealing a ball and charging front gives a good advantage.

As for dribbling, here are a few moves:-

The Dream Shake is a pretty simple yet effective move.

The normal stepback, but just shake up the defense a little bit before that you know?

Just try few floaters here and there.

Drive front near the basket but then suddenly but not too fast, allow the defender to catch up and then pull back as much as your shooting range allows.

Use both hands, do not depend on one.

Do some crossover, between both hands.

Right-Left-Right-Charge right and get a quick release in. (defender does not catch up)

\-Charge right, defender catches up, stop and pass the ball if no space.

Disguise passes as shots or shots as passes sometimes.

I get into the shooting position and shoot, but to the teammate instead of basket SOMETIMES.

Behind the back, between the legs.

Try altering your release time a bit to catch your defender off guard.

If you are being double-teamed then someone from your team must be free.

If you break through one defender and another reaches in, study the position of teammate before or during the play, pass the ball in any way (chest pass, behind the back, between defenders' legs or anything).Just get the ball inside the basket most efficiently.

Run for the ball when your team has it, run for the ball when your opponent has it. By this, I mean just stay in the same boat as the player with the ball.

When a player screens you, do not bother who did or how it happened. Sidestep and get where you have to be. Be on constant movement, keep your defender on the edge.

If you are playing against any opponent, and they are able to match you, always have that punch to be used in emergencies.

Stay near the ball or its handler but pl do not be a ball hog unless your teammates are bad.

Fadeaways can make good space but also work on behind the back, figure 8 dribbles, bullet passes. Anything which gives you the advantage, just do it (but play clean, unless your opponent is playing dirty then it is your choice just do no kill them.)

EDIT-Look at the opponent also not just the ball. Try to think how to make new plays when at home.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Try working on your foot work so you can develop some driving moves. Having a nice euro step is a deadly move,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Don’t dribble to much like I play Centre I am 6’6” and only 15 but I play combined roles of paint beast in defence I can play offence and get rebounds I am a very good passer and can kinda dribble but prefer not to because no single player can move faster than a ball unlike you I am good in all type of game like 1v1 or 5v5 but I can also play 2v1 and so on so basically what you want to try and do is find what your best at and focus on that in you game during 5v5 to harness the skill faster and make more effective and in 1v1 try improve things your worst at for that 3pt shoots or always trying to keep my defensive position.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hey guys, looking for advice on a new ball shoe. I've been wearing a pair of PG2's for the last year and they're worn out now, mostly because I've been using them outdoors recently due to the pandemic. I really like how this shoe hugs my foot and holds it in place, ankle support is great, but what I do find lacking is any kind of bounce. Also, the shoe feels like it has no flex so it is hard for me to push off with my forefoot on jumpshots.

I'm the biggest guy in my play group at 6'2 so I usually fulfill the role of the center - rebounds, rim protection, post-ups, etc. I also take a lot of jump shots on offense. Basically what I'm saying is I get vertical a lot, so I need a shoe that helps me with this. I need some bounce, cushioning, and impact protection. I also play out on the perimeter a fair bit because I'm a good shooter and I like to drive.

I feel like despite being the big in my group, my playstyle is much more like a wing/forward who can play out on the perimeter or down in the post depending on my match-up. So I'm looking for a shoe that can handle both.

From watching and reading reviews, the shoes I'm considering right now are the Air Jordan XXXIV, Nike KD 12 or 13, Jordan Why Not? Zer0.3, NB Omn1s, Kyrie 6, Harden Vol 4, and Dame 5 (largely because it is supposed to be good for outdoor play). I will likely end up picking up 2 new pairs, one for outdoors and one for indoors for when gyms open up again.

I have not owned a lot of ball shoes in the past so any help narrowing down this list is much appreciated. I'm getting more into this and I'm enjoying learning about ball shoes more. If you have questions about my playstyle/preferences let me know. Also, if you have a recommendation that isn't on this list feel free to mention it!

Thank you in advance from a budding sneakerhead!",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess it comes down to the eye test. When you watch the NBA you see coordination, sophistication and a certain ‘standard’ to how players play. Streetball on the other hand, is wilder, more for entertainment purposes rather than winning. 

One great example would probably be Jamal Crawford. His dribbling is so unorthodox when seen in the NBA but it would be pretty common in Streetball. 

To sum it up I guess NBA is sophisticated and functional, while Streetball is flashy and fun.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In SB, you are a lot less restricted in terms of creativity and style, as seen with the dribbling tricks you mentioned and often the lack of a shot clock. It's more like 5 1 on 1 matchups than the NBA's 1 5 on 5 matchup system.

In the NBA, though, players have to bend rules and play with the defense (which is not played with the same attention to detail in SB, but admittedly has become soft in the league and more about cerebral defense than physicality) in order to achieve the most efficient shot on as near as makes no difference 100 possessions per game. Stats are also tracked more accurately so the personal element of the game means more to some players, see James Harden always averaging more than 30 and many other stat padders over the years. And lastly, the preparation and studying that players go through before games means that they are so much more precise with literally every thought and movement. Bouncing the ball of someone's head and stepping back over them, for example, works in SB often as long as you put the defender to sleep with a lot of fast dribbles. In the NBA, try that and not only will the defensive player try to steal the ball during your move, they'll likely foul you hard so as not to look like a fool in front of the millions of viewers.

Lastly, with only 24 seconds on the clock, if your complex streetball iso move does not lose the defender and clear you for an open shot, there is so little time to create a good shot on a set 5 man defense that, while you were doing all those crazy dribbles, keyed in on the potential passing and driving lanes, closing off your options entirely. We see players use certain SB derived moves in the league all the time though, and those movements have led players to great heights! Think about Kyrie's 1 on 1 abilities as a member of the Cavs, James Harden's unreal isolation dribbling, and all of the amazing dunks, such as windmills, Eastbays, and off the board throwdowns that really came from the game of the streets!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's mainly in the rules imo. Streetball tends to carry the ball, and travel. As for why you don't see many moves like that in the NBA, there are some players that have occasionally mixed them in, think Irving, J-wil, Rafer. But in my opinion the biggest reason is the competition level, NBA defense (even though people complain about it) is the best in the world. Just makes it harder to do things like the professor does on good players. Think about it like why players don't ""fresstyle"" in rocketleague pros often... it's just a much harder thing to do with that level of defense and reactions speed.",,,,,,,

I'm 6'3 and just really started really focusing on my vertical and improving my athleticism this past year. For me, I'd say two hands is just a mental barrier. I prefer dunking with 2 hands over 1 everytime especially when I am going off 2 feet. I attached an article that breaks down jumping off 2, as well as the video from it that I thought does a good job as well. I would say work on your 2 foot technique and you will see improvements pretty quickly. Make sure you're not losing any power, energy and speed through your strides and jump. Best way is to record yourself and try to break it down as best you can! 

The last link is a video of me dunking a couple with 2 hands, I'm just a spot up shooter, not known for dunking 😂

,Basketball,"Hello everyone 

It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. 

To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  
I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that? 

Any help or oppinion is greatly appreciated.

Drill number 2 what you do is take 15 shots just outside the circle on the rim then like around 7.5 feet away do the same 15 shots and the from free throw range do the same 15 shots and then move onto the three pointer and take 25 shots like in nba 3pt contest and every week try to improve you %",,,,,,,

“To be able to put this together and put a stamp of legitimacy on it from the global governing body is obviously a huge step for us,” Beyer said, “especially when you step back, four years ago, it was a very loose confederation and concept where there was no one backing us.”

 

The FIBA approval is a crucial step and was the East Asia Super League’s second piece of big news from this summer, a sign of the league’s momentum even in the midst of a pandemic that has forced most international sports to seize up. The pandemic has caused this year’s The Terrific 12 tournament to be delayed indefinitely. Logic would dictate that it would be tremendously difficult to pull off in light of the need for COVID-19 testing and quarantining, plus the added rigor of acquiring visas and traveling. ",,,,,,,

If opposing players are out there talking trash to you or whoever else comes around, try not to take it personally. 

If your own teammates are getting pissed at you because of mistakes you're making, try to reflect and think about whether their criticism is justified (even if it's poorly presented). Maybe use that as motivation to continue improving. 

If games as a whole tend to devolve into a dumpster fire where everyone's arguing about foul calls every other play, then you might just need to find a new place to play. 

I know some comments here say that super toxic trash talk exists everywhere you go but the good news is that's not true. Some places just seem to attract those types of people more than others. The more controlled and consistent environment you can find - where the same general group of players is showing up with the same reason for being there (having fun, working out, improving) - the better chance you have of yielding the experience you're looking for.

As I've gotten older, I've grown to value my sanity a little more when it comes to playing pick-up ball. I used to accept those toxic environments as being the price to pay for wanting to play ball. But I tend to pass on those opportunities more and more these days.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Referee here. Yes, this is a foul. I'm always a bit amused at the questions asking whether pushing is a foul. Yes, pushing is a foul. In a pickup game you're playing with house rules, but in a sanctioned game, what you describe sounds like grounds for an intentional or flagrant foul.

Look up what legal guarding position is and what a defender is permitted to do once they have established LGP. When the offensive player is an airborne shooter (this includes a dunk attempt), a defender cannot undercut the shooter. To always be safe, make sure you are making a play on the ball.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"That, my friend, is called bush league.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably a flagrant foul, to be honest. That ""defense"" injures people and starts fights.

The defender is entitled to the space he is on, and to jump straight up and down. He can jump, and put his hands straight up into the air to bother the attacker. Even if there is contact, it is not a foul.

Of course if the defender is able to jump, and, without hitting the defender, get his hand on the ball or slap it away, it's a legal block.

Typically, if the first contact is defender's hand to ball, refs won't call a foul on any subsequent body contact, though your mileage may vary.

If the dunker is much larger than the defender, the defender can attempt to take a charge. If he is planted ""legal guarding position"" by the time the attacker leaves the floor, and the attacker just runs him over, it's an offensive foul. If the defender is moving just prior to contact, or slides in after the attacker is off his feet, it'd be a blocking foul.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's obviously a foul and potentially very dangerous. 

In outdoor pick-up basketball especially, we generally had some unwritten rules when it came to defending dunks. 

* Never push a dunker when he's airborne

* Don't undercut a dunker (charges generally aren't a thing in pick-up so there's little point to sliding underneath an airborne player). 

* Be weary of tracking down a dunker in a high-speed, chasedown scenario when there's a metal basketball pole in the vicinity (as is the case on most outdoor courts). 

In indoor, organized leagues where something was on the line, I was a lot more understanding of everything defenses would do to stop me from dunking (except for the pushing). But in pick-up games, my motto is basically, ""C'mon dude, my health insurance isn't that great, so can we maybe use a bit of common sense here?""",,,,,,,

I hear kids say things like “your man put up 20 points on you” without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they’re only responsibility is the player they’re assigned to.

I've coached some lower level middle school teams over the years where it was just kind of understood that these kids needed an opportunity to develop their basic skills and get some real game experience. Yet I'd always run into a couple opposing coaches of similarly low-skilled teams (B teams, most often) who'd just pack the paint in a 2-3 zone all game. 

The result, of course, would be my team having an impossible time scoring because they're all beginners without the capabilities of exposing a zone (where even hitting a jump shot is a sketchy preposition) while the defense generally just stands still with their hands up all game. There's always this goal of winning, but I'm also huge on development and learning - especially with low level B team basketball, so I'd always come away from those types of games wondering what we even accomplished.",,,,,,,

In many cases, the lowest man wins. So if an offensive player is strong and upright, he still may not be able to do a whole lot against a defender who's low to the ground and stable. 

On the other hand, if a defender is over-relying on push-back (especially if a lean is involved), that's something that can be used against them (baseline spin or other quick evasive move around).",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If he is putting one of his legs under you, between your two legs, you can spin off him.

For example, if his right leg is wedged under you, you can spin quickly over your right shoulder and he won't be there to stop you. Similarly it is his left leg wedged underneath, spin over your left shoulder. If you haven't used your dribble yet this is an easy way to get to the basket. Little bit trickier with a live dribble.

It's hard to post up anyone if you are just walking in it from 20 feet out. 80% of a successful post-up happens before the catch. Get a solid seal deep in the paint. Hit him when he is relaxed and not expecting it, demand the ball from your guard while giving him a hand target.

Officiating on post-ups is very inconsistent across levels. If his back is to you, you can use an arm bar across his low back/on his hip. Generally, the defender can stand their ground. If the offensive player is banging, refs will allow the defender to push back (through an arm bar) if it is timed right.

That said, I can still develop my left-hand to varying degrees. Left-handed ball-handling, left-handed layups off two-footed takeoffs, etc. Sometimes it's just about identifying who you are and how to develop your game within that frame.

Then again, depending on your age, you really might just need to trust your own development. Maybe you haven't put in the extensive training to really pay off just yet.

I'll tell you how I'd work on this with guys. Take it or leave it.

You say your midrange game is good, thats a good place to start. Warmup, then just start knocking down spot shots from within your comfort zone. Maybe 20 or 30 makes. Now take 1 big step back and shoot from there. One spot at a time, don't move around. If you miss three in a row, step back into your midrange comfort zone and shoot until you make 3 in a row. Then the big step back out.

Make 5 in a row from a spot, then head to a different spot.

After 2-3 sessions, you will find the ""one step back"" area now feels in your comfort zone. Now you can start going 2 big steps back. Then 3.

Don't stop when you are making 3s with your toes on the line. Need to be able to drill them from your spacing spots. Develop range from 3 or 4 feet back from the line.

Don't worry about off-the-dribble, catching on the move, or off an attacking move right now. First you must develop basic catch and shoot to a high level of accuracy.

Focus on shooting above the break for PG, unless your team's office has the PG clear to corner after making an entry pass. In that case focus on corners.

Is your team's facility open for use? Do they have a rebounding machine? Very useful for this type of practice. Ask your coach.

I think you can get from midrange to 3pt range in 8-10 sessions of focused, intentional practice barring any major mechanical issues.

Best of luck to you.",,,,,,,

In a perfect world, you'd want to be working with a 10-foot rim on a beautiful indoor hardwood floor but many folks don't have that luxury. 

In your case, working with a shorter hoop is going to be 100 percent  more beneficial than working on no hoop at all, and I say this as someone with experience on shorter hoops. There *is* undoubtedly an adjustment period where you'd have to tinker with your mechanics when you get to a real rim, but there's so much that can be worked on and refined in the meantime. 

For reference, there's been a lot of NBA players throughout history (particularly prior to the modern era) who grew up in areas where the closest they got to a basketball hoop was a milk crate nailed to a telephone pole. I grew up, in part, playing on a dirt-rock surface with a hoop that was under 10 feet. If you've got a hoop, you can work on things and improve, no matter the circumstances.",,,,,,,

&gt;Sorry but this is a serious competion it is in the European system but it isn't just for fun, everyone is trying their hardest to win

I mean this politely, but if the league is that serious I would have assumed it'd have at least a couple guys who could make more than 25 percent of their 3-pointers in shooting drills. 

Our amateur line is generally shorter in America (6.02 m) but even extending out to 6.7 m it seems like I know a fair amount of fellow players (myself included) who can certainly connect on more than 25 percent during shooting drills (at 6.02, we're often comfortably above 60-65 percent... which is still far from elite but solid enough).

Point being, if you're playing among guys who can knock down that shot at a better-than-abysmal rate then there's lots of benefits. It's a weapon and players out our way grow up knowing it's a weapon, which is kind of how we ended up where we are with basketball as a whole today (most leagues shooting more 3-pointers than ever with many teams using them as a cornerstone of success). 

Then again, it could just be a cultural or regional difference. I'm 36 years old and we grew up shooting (and hitting) lots of threes. It seems like organized basketball is just now catching up to what we were doing in pick-up games years ago.

That said, yeah, since the advent of the 3-point line there also always been guys shooting them who shouldn't be. It's seductive and hard to resist.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll just throw it out there but one thing most NBA players regret the most is not learning how to shoot properly earlier in their development.

That means finding your best shooting path (the path that the ball will always travel in front of your body when getting into your shot), repeatable mechanics (don't have a hitch, preferably a one motion shot instead of two motion) and being able to replicate it properly (having your shoulder aligned to the net, having your hand on the middle of the ball, having feet set properly etc etc)

Of course neglecting ball handling is not good, but you can somewhat work on your handles right before you shoot to make sure you shoot in rhythm. (Like a 1-2 step shot or dribble a bit before going into a hop). It will help you have tighter handles and force you to work on your footwork to be able to shoot properly balanced jump shots.

If you are planning on playing competively, having a decent outside shot will open up the floor for you, allowing for easier drives to the basket. That + good defense will allow you to be useful for any team.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Get really good at handling the ball my ball-handling workout I do daily looks like this:

Do about 50 reps of each move (left/right hand pound dribbles, crossover, between the legs, behind the back, in and out, and scissor dribbles). (8-10 minutes)

Then set up cones or something similar in a line with about 4-5 feet in between each and practice doing these moves while moving through the cones. Do about 3-5 sets for each move (5-10 minutes depending on if you want to shoot a layup after each set which I recommend)

This next part will sound dumb but some of the best ball handlers in the world use this method or something similar: Find yourself something plastic that you can wrap your ball in, it could be a plastic grocery bag, anything that will take the grip away from the ball and still have that basketball slipperiness to it.

There is absolutely no reason you can't or shouldn't excel in both.

With that said, you should be realistic about playing basketball professionally.

\&gt; I would even be okay if I ended up making the G-League or something

There are maybe but a few thousand professional basketball jobs, IN THE WORLD, and even good players at the college level will struggle to play professionally. Unless you are already so freaking good that college/pro scouts are already checking out your AAU games, any 12 year old who says they are playing basketball to prepare for a professional career is being insanely unrealistic--you are setting yourself up for failure.

Instead, set yourself up for success. Set small, incremental goals. Aspire to hit X/100 3's in practice. Aspire to beat someone 1x1 whom you've never beaten before. Aspire to make your HS JV then varsity team. Aspire to be a starter, and so and and so on. Most importantly, play basketball because it's fun. Play it for the ""love of the game"" and you will never wonder if your time spent on basketball is worth it or not.

But like winning the lottery only a very, very few people live that dream.

Basketball is so much more than a profession.  It is a beautiful game that has so many levels.

So many times I see this same question being asked on this sub and it makes me sad to think that someone like you would give up the game because the chances are you won't make it in the NBA.

Truth is a extremely high percentage of players won't make any professional leagues. 

But that doesn't matter. It's still a great game that can and will give back just as much or more than you put into it.

I think you should play as long and as hard as you can, but also don't neglect your studies. See were your game takes you.  Maybe it will just end up being something you do as a stress reliever that keeps you in great shape or maybe you will be good enough to be considered for a scholarship in college.  Whatever, at 12 you have no idea how good you will become or how much you will grow.

Play the game and try to be better tomorrow than you are today.
Go out for teams and see where it leads.  If you don't make the team its ok.  It's discouraging, but ok. Keep playing.   Even if you never make a school team there are other teams you can get on....city leagues, rec leagues or just pick up games. 

And there are also tons of jobs connected to basketball. So if you don't make it as a player you might consider coaching or physical therapy or basketball equipment sales or team doctor....it goes on and on.

I firmly believe that playing the game of basketball makes you a better person.  No matter what level. 

Be well rounded.  Play hard and study hard.

Good Luck

If you love playing don't stop, you will regret it if you do.

Much love",,,,,,,

Depending on your height when you’re fully grown you will have a massive advantage over your peers and be able to develop. If I have one word of advice, I’d say don’t get locked to a center/big man position.

As almost everybody has mentioned here, you play it because you enjoy it.

But that is not all. Because at the end of the day, there are other enjoyable things as well and you give a lot of them up to spend more time with your academics, especially if you want to end up at a good college. Basketball is great for getting you into a good college even if you are an average but dedicated player.

First, there is the time commitment in your college application. Saying that you have spent 15+ hours a week for the last 10 years on something is impressive. It shows that you are capable of commitment.

But even more than that, playing basketball gives you so many more skills that are useful outside the court, that will eventually make you a great catch for a great college (if you have the right approach of course). 

Think about it. How many of your friends can get perform well after getting yelled at by a teacher? If you are a player, sometimes you will get humiliated by your coach in front of hundreds of your friends and family and you will get out there and perform anyway. How many of your friends will know how to be graceful both when winning and when losing? How many will know how to cheer for somebody wholeheartedly?

There is so much more to basketball than putting that ball through the hoop. So if you enjoy playing, keep playing. Even if you never win anything but play with the right attitude it will make you a better person and a better college applicant. If you are not sure about what the right attitude is, I highly recommend [Dick DeVenzio's Think Like a Champion](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Champion-Championship-Student-Athletes/dp/1933538546).",,,,,,,

With just a 3/4 tips, he has been able to change my shooting form completely, and now it feels so easy, so effective and effortless. I was able to balance the force used better, to focus on my aiming more, and my body just felt right throughout all the shooting move.

Turned out he is a pro basketball player, he plays 2nd national division in my country and is here on vacation lol. He made my day. He was so supportive and nice, even when we chatted for a while afterwards.

Don't ask me why I didn't learn my lesson the first time around, but I didn't. I sure learned my lesson the second time around. 

If I don't have basketball shoes on, I don't play anymore. I suggest you do the same. I love basketball as much as the next guy in this subreddit, but dude - it's just not worth it.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yo I used to twist my ankles all the time.  It caused other injuries up the leg and back.  And worst of all I had to sit out while all my friends were balling.  I recommend yoga to work on balance.  It will reset your legs so that your ankles are strong enough to support your game.  It will activate your hips to take some of the burden off your ankles and knees.  

If yoga isn’t your thing, you can just find the stretches and exercises from yoga to help build strength and balance.  Take it from me, 31 year old average build, if you don’t work on your body it’s only going to get worse",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who has glass ankles, the best advice I can give you is to rehab properly. Whether the ankle injury is minor and severe, using the RICE method and strengthening exercises will help reduce return to play time. Consider using an ankle brace if you aren't confident coming back from your injury.

The biggest predictor of injury is previous injury. Once you twist/sprain your ankle, there is a likelihood it may occur again, but can be prevented with as said above. Ex. Curry with his ankles, Jabari Parker tearing his ACL twice, Durant's calf strain leading to his Achilles rupture, etc.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean, you answered your own question.  Make sure to always wear your basketball shoes. Your ankles need the support. And make sure to take the time to heal, as someone else said.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Take a break. Let it heal. The first couple times it'll just be kinda painful and uncomfortable. But each time you twist it, it becomes easier to twist and the twist can become more severe. The last thing you want is to get a high grade sprain when a week or two of recovery would have saved you. Source: didn't rest after first twist, next sprain forced me into rest and lifelong ankle complications. [Pic of ankle damage *graphic](http://imgur.com/a/jQpNmln)",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who had multiple sprains each season through highschool and still occasionally since, start finding ways to strengthen your ankles and learn how to work on your footwork in a way that is properly supporting you at all times. Also start learning to do warm ups that help strengthen your knees. If you get to a point where you brace or tape your ankles, it puts your knees at higher risk, and that is a much worse injury.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You gotta rest them after a sprain. Every time you get injured you become more susceptible to a serious injury. I didn’t rest after rolling it a few times in a month and boom ruptured achilles. 2 years of rehab to feel sorta the same. Rest up don’t rush back your health is more important than one day of basketball. You’ll thank yourself in the long run for taking caution or regret not doing it when you get a serious injury.

Edit: do more stretches to raise the limits of how flexible your body is. Also when you feel you might be rolling your ankle instead of trying to stay up fall over to alleviate the pressure applied to your body. Stephen curry does it all the time to protect his ankles from rolling. I’m sure there is a video on YouTube about it somewhere.",,,,,,,

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that his athletism and passing skills and court visions are one of the greatest in nba history&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he needs to be able to score from any spot on the field to carry the team and win the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight lebron was great, but he wasn&amp;#39;t able to win the game,cuz he just can&amp;#39;t shoot &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillard? He scored 4 deep threes in  6 mins remaining in 4th qtr
Anthony? He didn&amp;#39;t do very good today, but still he made a three pointer that concluded the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If lebron doesn&amp;#39;t improve his shooting skills, he will never be on the same page with Michael Jordan 
Not even magic johnson or kareem &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who won 5 or more titles in nba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lebron needs to be able to shoot from midrange and score without anyone&amp;#39;s help&lt;br/&gt;

I've done a few posts on how to make your high school squad, now I want to focus on AAU/Grassroots/Club/Select specifically in North America.

Context: I will be speaking to boys and girls who are currently in grades 7-11 who intend to play college ball at some level.

It's the time of year (December/January) where grassroots teams are putting their rosters together and the whole system is wrought with misinformation because, for the better clubs, this is a business and they need to make money.

Let me start by defining the levels of club teams

**Elite shoe circuit**: These are limited in number by the three circuits (Nike, Adidas, Under Armor) with each having about 24 teams total. Their calendars are anchored by exclusive events happening during NCAA DI evaluation periods. These teams are generally put together on an invite-only basis and by this time of year their rosters are 80% locked. These teams also get prime draws and courts at open (non shoe circuit eval events) which means DI coaches are on the baseline.

**Elite non shoe circuit:** Since shoe circuits limit their teams there are also quite a few independent clubs that have elite teams that will get prime draws and courts at non-shoe events. They are just locked out of the shoe events. There are generally independent events in the same cities as the shoe events where these clubs play so college coaches can hit multiple events in one trip.

**Second tier elite:** Shoe circuit clubs and independent clubs have a group of lower tier teams and usually one of those is not quite elite but is close. For Nike and Under Armor their events don't have a place for these teams so they will play exclusively independent events. Adidas has a ""Gold"" level at their events so the second tier teams have a place to play. Independent clubs will bring their second tier team to the same eval events and put them in a lower bracket where they can still get some exposure.

**National Club:** This is where it starts to get a little shady in my opinion. This is the level where most clubs are just taking your money. Shoe and independent clubs have teams at this level. You pay full price to be on the team, $1,000 - $2,000, plus you have to cover travel expenses, do fundraisers, pay extra fees. Yes these teams get to national level eval events but they are generally on a terrible draw playing at the back of the gym or alternate site with zero coaches sitting on the baselines. These teams exist to cover the cost of the higher level teams as often the top team in club is full scholarship. National teams are also often too big with 12+ players.

**Regional Club:** These teams play a mix of local and regional events that they can drive to and generally don't require a hotel stay. Unless you are in Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Atlanta, DMV, or a few other locations these teams aren't playing at important Eval events and if they are, they are on courts/draws that aren't getting looks. This is purely developmental. If the price isn't too high it's a good place to be in 7-10 grade if you aren't a clear D1 prospect but maybe have your sights on D2, 3, NAIA. Avoid coaches that over-hype the looks you get at this level. Larger clubs with Elite teams often have teams at this level as well. In that context this functions as a developmental team for the upper level teams in the organization.

**Local Club:** Purely developmental teams that play in local events and leagues. Generally not playing in events that have college coaches attending. Focus is on skill development and making your high school team

**Dad team:** A ""club"" with one team coached by a player's dad who didn't like the local or regional club and thought they could do better. Effectively a local club but lacking a pipeline to higher level teams. Avoid this.

**Recreation Club:** You local rec league at the rec center or YMCA. Not somewhere you should be if you're in middle school or older and seriously thinking about playing at some college level.

So which level should you play on? Everyone wants to play at that elite level but not everyone is at that level. Even players that can and will play D1 ball don't necessarily need to be on an elite shoe team. There are about 1,000 scholarships at D1 level (Men and Women) every year and those elite levels have less players in each class than that so don't think being on that team is do or die. Plus those teams often have players headed to D2 and below.

I'd also like to point out that playing college ball at any level (D1, 2, 3 or NAIA) is a fantastic experience and a four year D2, 3 or NAIA player would come to your local pickup game and completely light up your gym. They are good players.

To simplify I'll break them down to three groups; national, regional, local.

**National:** (Elite, Non-shoe elite, 2nd tier elite) You should only play on a team that travels nationally if you are personally invited to be on the team or personally invited to try out. These teams will discover players at early season varsity tournaments so by now you should have already heard from them if they like you. If you have to shop yourself to a national level team you're probably not ready. If you do sign up for a lesser team there should be zero reason to do any overnight travel for events that are not during evaluation periods in major cities. For boys it's rare for Sophomore and below to be invited to these team. Occasionally I'll see an 8th grade girl who is ready for this level.

**Regional:** Are you a starter for your school team regardless of level but not yet getting invites to elite clubs? This is likely the level of team to be looking at. Price will be a consideration, coaching style, and practice/event schedule but the main thing I like to tell players is do not waste time on a team with more than 10 players. There is no point in paying money to sit on the bench. 8 or 9 players is ideal and 11 is a no go. You're here to get minutes.

**Local:** This is the place to be if you're looking to develop your game so pick a team that practices often. This is the place to be if you come off the bench for your school team and you're looking to get into the starting lineup. The key here is getting hours in the gym and minutes in games. My favorite local clubs are the ones that have access to their own gym(s).

It may seem early but now is the time to start planning your spring and summer. That's where you get better and get ready for the next level.",,,,,,,

It will be the hardest thing you ever do. You need to sacrifice lots of shorterm pleasures like sleep, hanging with people, girls, parties, and video games. Also when you workout you have to go at game speed b/c that is how games are played and if you arent used to playing that way then you will get outplayed by everyone else thus not standout to coaches and thus not get an offer. Also you should play in the eybl, adidas gaunlet, or under armour association b/c a majority of college coaches go to those games to offer players. There is a reason very few high school players have a college career, it is hard af even d2 or d3. When u workout there will be times that you feel like that this isnt for you, keep pushing because it will seem like a joke compared to college and the rewards (full ride scholarship, bond with teammates, travel the country/world, etc) is worth it. Also a very important video to watch is called ""6 keys to basketball training"" by ShotMechanics. It will give you very useful info in getting better. Since you are 6'3 you will have to be a guard. Some people may say that youre tall so play post but you are only tall relative to average male height in the USA (5'9) and you are short compared to college bball height however which may be 6'5 and up. Look up short players they got the best bag of moves Chris Paul, Zion Harmon, Sharife Cooper, Chris Lykes, 5'9 Isiah Thomas of the Celtics. Look up other players that have a great bag that are taller like Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bradley Beal. There are probably more so if I were you I would go to a bunch of basketball focused subreddits and comment sections all over the internet like IG, Twitter, and YouTube and ask them which players have the best moveset. You will get more examples. Another thing when youre training, people may ask you to play pickup then when u say no they may say playing by urself doesnt make you better. They are lying cuz they need an extra person or saying that cuz they dont know what theyre talking about. If you arent good then nobody will pass you the ball on offense and they will have you guard the easiest opposing player. Also you may spend a lot of time waiting ur turn to play and people barely try sometimes in pickup. Therefore pickup games dont get u better. You should use pickup games to test stuff youve been working on and as a measuring gauge for what you need to improve on. Keep in mind that you are not the only person trying to go d1, there are millions of people that dream of this and thousands of people putting in effort to get it. If you are not willing to outwork all of those people then you wont make it. You gotta do work other people wont so you can play like other people cant.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hey man, Im no god at bball, hell Im not even ok, but here's my advice:

With anything in life, work, school, sports, etc there is going to be some stress and fear. Fear you won't perform to your coach's/teammate's standards, but more importantly YOUR fear of not living up to your OWN standards. As time goes on we become more comfortable in what we do, but for me:

AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY AND YOUR'S ALONE YOU WILL SUCCEED IF YOU HOLD YOURSELF UP TO A HIGH STANDARD

Im not saying you should go out there and steal the ball away from your teammates, but believe in your ability to get out there and get to work. Be confident but not overzealous. Focus on making the right play and, in the end, you can walk away from a night where you had 0pts, 2reb, 1 ast, and 7 to's and be fine with it. Its a hard thing to master and a delicate balance. If you have confidence and trust all that work you put in, you'll do just fine. I believe in you, but more importantly believe in YOURSELF. Believe you have the bball iq to know where to go on the fastbreak, believe you have the skill to go one on one with your opponent from the top of the key, believe in yourself that you have the ability to do what you put your mind to.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I’m sure your anxiety will get better as you play but you really need to temper your expectations if that is really an issue for you. I have no idea if you’re any good but if you’re scared to make a move and have to ask the internet why you’re not going anywhere in this sport.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brother , I know exactly what you mean. You think you shouldn't take any shots or drives because your teammates can get it done or you think that you'll mess things up with the ball in your hand but I am here to tell you you gotta find the things your good at and do your best with them. 

By no means am I LeBron James or Stephen Curry but I found out that after daily practicing I can hit about 6/10 or my baseline mid-range jumpers. So I take those when ever I see the opportunity without hesitation. When I miss it's ok because I know I can possibly make 60% and the next one is definitely going in. In other words man, find your offense and stick to it. (Also, don't be scared to cut into the paint and possibly get blocked. Get those easy buckets, it helps your team out a bunch and it is the easiest way to score outside of a open fast break layup).

Lastly, on defense I feel you when you say people blow by you. I'm only 19 and my left knee is shot so getting low is something I have to ration. Like a trump card or a secret weapon. (The lower person between a defender and offensive player always wins the battle, so ""get low"" like Lil Jon said). My only tip on defense is to call ever thing out, be vocal. If you think someone is quick then yell out a switch, call for drive back up and if your man is a shooter call it out let everyone know that you know. If he likes driving left call it out and let it be known you know what he likes to do. If you wanna play up on him and breath on his neck tell your teammates so that when he drives past you they can pick up. All this saves you energy on defense and believe it or not it gets defense stops.

TLDR: Make call outs and be super-efficient and every move you do, offense or defense. ""Efficiency is clever laziness"" -Echo Rainbow 6 Siege🙃",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I had a response written that seemed a little mean, but here's the main point: At 20, work on your anxiety and absolutely exercise and get out on the court. I know people for whom exercise is a great outlet to help overcome anxiety. Understand, though, that D3 players are a lot better than a large part of this sub thinks they are.

I've had kids win conference player of the year and go to a D3 school where they sat the bench for a couple years before they got on the floor. The players at that level can ball.

In the OP, you never say what you do well. We know you can't defend and won't make moves, attack the bucket or cut. It makes it sound like the only thing you do well is catch and shoot from midrange. If that's all you do well, anxiety won't be what keeps you off the roster.",,,,,,,

I only started balling last year but I've won matches against some really good players who represent their school and stuff so I guess I'm sorta qualified to give some advice. Anyway! I felt the same way as you a year ago, I would pass the ball everytime I'm under pressure and people always looked down on me because I had 0 skill and I was short. But what they didn't know was that after every session I'd still continue grinding, no matter if the sun was blazing hot or if it was raining heavily. I grinded so hard the players that have been playing 4 to 5 years finally acknowledged my grind and I can beat them with ease. In short, to not be anxious you just need to be confident, and confidence comes from acknowledging your self worth. If you worked your butt off to get here, then you'd be okay if you scored 0 an entire game if you knew you put your heart into it.",,,,,,,

I don't recommend NeverFlats. I bought a NeverFlat because I wanted to save the $7 it would take to buy an air pump. NeverFlats are always overinflated (you won't get a friendly bounce off the rims, and other people won't want to play with your ball -- and you'll think you're better at dribbling than you actually are).

I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. 

However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.

I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. 

I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). 

After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.

I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. 

I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. 

The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. 

I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. 

Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. 

I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. 

I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. 

**Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here…** 

I'll end with this…

My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cancelled my LP a season ago when I realized that I enjoyed watching any type of basketball and not just the NBA product. There are also some aspects of the NBA that are very annoying  - especially the preferential treatment towards superstars and reffing in general. Regular season games are also quite dull as teams have gotten more savvy about resting players.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It really depends on why you are watching. I love the game and watch most games because I like to pick apart player moves and tendencies as well as see how different strategies and matchups affect the outcomes. You can learn a lot if you really dissect the game vs watching people put a ball in the basket. It's not for everyone though and I understand where you are coming from such as if I liked to go bowling but I don't like it so much that I'm going to watch people bowl. You do you and some others have commented on watching other leagues that relate more to them and that's fine. I will say that the wnba is not well watched but they play amazingly fundamental basketball compared to men and perhaps that style may appeal to you more.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reading the comments I feel like a lot of you just don’t enjoy the smallest parts of the game that make watching basketball so much fun. I understand NBA regular season games are less exciting then playoffs or March Madness but watching the best players in the world play the most amazing game is always exciting. I watch every game I can because there is always some story line to follow like an upcoming player who’s on a hot streak or a matchup of former teammates. It’s like once you know how to watch the game and not just where the ball is but how each team moves and the momentum changes and exciting plays and defense then the game opens up and every game is new and exciting. Just my opinion but I bet there are some big basketball fans who feel the same way!,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Best thing you can do is work on cardio to prepare. The adjustment from half court to competitive full court games(not pickup) can be tough and you will tire out really fast.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know about the level of play in your league, but in our city rec leagues 6'2"" 190 will be on the big side. If this is true for you, teammates will love you if you focus on big men stuff on defense: rebound, help defense in the paint, etc. Even if you're relatively clueless, if you play hard on defense, respectable players will respect you.

As a smaller guard it really bugs me when bigs, or just players who don't shoot or drive well, float around the perimeter, mess up the spacing and passing lanes, and in turn make me less effective. As a beginner, you will be more effective for your team if you know your own game and limitations and play accordingly. If you are not comfortable shooting 3's or drive for more than 2 dribbles, the best places for you to be around the court are the low posts, high posts/elbow area, and the short corner/dunker's spots. These are prime real estate for bigs on offense, just rotating around those spots and trying to make a catch there will maximize your chances of doing something good. Some general rule of spacing: 1) if another one of your teammate is within 2-3 big strides of you (more if on the perimeter), then you're too close to each other: either cut away or politely tell your teammate to move; 2) don't be caught between a teammate and the basket (this takes away your teammate's option to drive to the basket), unless you're cutting/posting up for a layup: in which case, move away if you don't catch the pass. As a big you would be super useful to your team as a screener on and off the ball; if you don't know how or when or where to screen effectively, don't worry about it for now, but if you do, do it often and the guards on your team will buy you beers.

Other than that, make quick, decisive, simple plays. When your teammate has the ball, sprint hard to try and catch a pass, and sprint hard away if you don't get a pass. When you catch the ball, make quick decision to shoot (if you're open and in range), drive (if you're close enough and have a open lane to the basket), or pass (if you spot a open teammate). You pretty much want to either shoot/drive/pass immediately, or fake a shot/drive/pass first and then immediately shoot/drive/pass. The worst thing you can do, as a beginner, is to make a catch and then just hold onto the ball. You might think you're surveying for your options, but really this is just an opportunity for defender(s) to crowd you. More experienced players will see your inexperience and salivate at the chance to take advantage and try to make a steal whenever you have the ball (I know I would). But when you're quick and decisive with your play, even if you make the wrong read, you're keeping the ball moving and 1 step ahead of the defense, and allows your teammates to take advantage even if you cannot yourself. It will also be easier for you teammates to coach you up and figure out how you can best play well together as a team.

Focus on rebounds, setting screens, pick and roll, finishing at the rim which is gonna be very important since you will grab a lot of rebounds you gotta know how to finish at the rim and also free throw because you will get fouled when you go to the rim especially if you are playing as the center.

Part of becoming a better player is doing things in game that you haven’t done before (but have worked on) and aren’t 100% comfortable doing in game, but start off in your comfort zone and slowly build from there as you play more games and get better and learn new moves. Defensively, just know the difference between how to position your feet depending on the dominant hand of who you’re defending (left leg further in front for a righty, right foot gutter in front for a lefty) and for the most part defense is effort so you can control that.

Small ball is generally used when the team plays a smaller lineup (usually by getting rid of the traditional center and have a PF play the 5. In Houston's case, they have a SF playing C lol)

You sacrifice size, low post offense/def for a smaller, quicker player for more speed, versatility and 3 point shooting (though a lot of bigs are extending their range to become more viable nowadays)

Essentially, the offensive pace gets faster (equals more shots) and the 3 point shooting gets better so you are able to create more space on the floor by drawing defenders out of the paint to defend the 3 point line.

It became really popular when Golden State used their death lineup"" of Steph curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes (Kevin Durant) and saw some amazing success.

The NBA is a copycat league so other teams used the Golden State Warriors as a template and started going smaller to increase their pace and 3 point shooting.",,,,,,,

The average NBA player is 6’7”.

But there are advantages that tend to go along with smaller size: running faster, accelerating and stopping faster, better change of direction. The thing is, out of two equally quick/agile, equally skilled players, the taller one will have an advantage. That’s why, once you get to the NBA level, you see the tallest hyper-quick guys filling most of the small man roster spots.

The reason why Muggsy could have a long career and Isaiah Thomas could flat out dominate when healthy is that players aren’t equally skilled, and those guys were so incredible they could be the exception to the rule.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While short players do tend to be faster when all else being equal, the main thing is that shorter players tend to be better because there are simply more short people. 


A very low percentage of people below 6'4 make the NBA, a high percentage above 6'9 do. As such if you're 6'10 and in the NBA you're probably only a top 1% athlete.

While someone who is 6'2 is in the top 0.001% of athletes. They don't have the size to make the NBA, so to get there they must be highly skilled and very athletic. 



The misconception people have is that they see tall nba players and since they are less athletic than short players, they assume the height caused the lack of athleticism, while this is partially true, its mostly selection bias. 

You can be less skilled and less athletic, but if you're big you might make the NBA. The same thing can't be said of shorter players",,,,,,,

Many old-school coaches would probably disagree, but outside of free throw situations, I think box-out drills are overrated. The best rebounders can read and react to where the ball is going which is why baseball players often rebound well.

In terms of post moves, YouTube drop step and reverse pivot. If you can execute those fundamentals at try-outs your coaches will be impressed.

I’d also encourage you to try and be as versatile as possible and not limit yourself to a traditional power forward role. Practice dribbling and shooting with proper mechanics.

At try-outs an underrated thing I look for in kids is what type of energy they play with. Maybe that’s communicating on defense or hyping up a teammate in a scrimmage. Attitude goes a long way.

I always see people say “take x number of shots a day,” but the key is to take quality reps by putting up real-game situation shots like floaters, shooting off the catch with a hop or 1-2, or off-balance layups.

It may be hard to get real game reps in with covid depending on where you live, but I always encourage kids to play 1-on-1 against players that are better than you and don’t be afraid to ask them to help you develop your game.

Now I can barely touch the rim on a good day (I'm 33). You're still quite young though, you have time.

As far as getting your vert up you need to train quite a bit to gain that much height or your jump. I'm fairly certain that nowadays multiple training programs exist for that purpose exactly.",,,,,,,

Anyone can tryout, all you have to do is sign up. 

As for the team you tryout for that is a little different. Coaches usually know who will already be on the team based on the open gyms that the host throughout the year before tryouts start. If you havent proved to coaches during those open gyms that you are good enough then you have to tryout for you age group. 

* 9th graders tryout for Freshmen Team
* 10th graders tryout for Reserve Team
* 11th graders tryout for Junior Varsity
* 12th graders tryout for Varsity

12th graders dont often tryout for varsity b/c when u are at that age coaches at the school should know who you are and if you werent on the teams prior then more likely you wont be on the team for varsity. 

So for some people tryouts is just your first day of practice for other people tryouts is actually trying to prove your good enough to be on the team.",,,,,,,

You need to work on SOMETHING. every. day. Even if it’s for 30 minutes or 2 hours, you need to go hard in that period. Wether it’s shots, dribbling, etc. Start running everyday to get your cardio up. just focus on your fundamentals and let the game come to you. However, don’t underestimate the work it takes. You need to be somewhere working on something everyday. Get some friends to help come rebound for you. At minimum try to get up 150+ shots a day. Develop muscle memory so it becomes second nature. Repetition is key. Get. In. shape.  so that you can just focus on the game instead of being tired and trying to perform. Good luck bro",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shooting and dribbling are the most visible aspects of basketball and sure if you’re exceptional you can be a good isolation player but find 5v5 and practice your team play and what you can do to make your teammates open.,,,,,,,

This probably goes against what most others believe, but I have no problem with you practicing on a lower net in the short-term. Kids often develop bad shooting fundamentals because they need to over-compensate to muscle the ball up to the rim. Focus on your mechanics and practice for no less than an hour a day. The more you practice the more confidence you’ll gain, and shooting is all about confidence.

When you practice, don’t just shoot around. Shoot around with a purpose by taking real game shots (contested layups, floaters, catch and shoot using the hop or 1-2, etc.). Your neighbors and friends might think you look weird, but I promise that’ll help accelerate your game.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Raise the hoop to 10 feet immediately and never lower it again. You're already 12.

2. Strength and conditioning. Seems like your height is in order but you'll need explosiveness/muscle. With help from your parents, start to eat right. 

3. Start playing 3v3s to understand the team setting including ball movement, switches, passing, etc. 

4. It's alright if you can't shoot 3s right now. It's not a part of everybody's game. Mid-range would be something worth nailing down.

EDIT:
5. If or when you do make it to the high school team, get to know your coach. Ask how you can contribute, improve, etc.",,,,,,,

Some advice I can give you, is to always play on a regulation net/court, playing on a non-regulation hoop/court will give you bad habits. Another piece of feedback, is to block out all negative comments (or at least try to) be in your own zone and utilize your strengths. I am only 5’3” and it is definitely a struggle to get a good vertical, you need to put in work improving your jump and using online tips. But on top of everything MAKE SURE YOU PLAY EVERYDAY (or at least every other day) the only way to get better is from practice and repetition, and my game has proven that over the last few years. If your shot is bad, definitely practice 3’s regularly, they will improve your range, and shooting overall, basketball has a lot of shooting involved. But to keep in shape and agile, you need to workout as much as possible, whether it’s basketball or cross training, keep yourself fit. But overall, don’t jet discouraged, keep chasing your dreams in whatever they may be. Good luck",,,,,,,

Communication is key, that leads to good energy and every coach wants a high energy player they can rely on.. strength is also very important, you have to be a strong ball handler and physically strong. I would recommend doing push ups every single day. When I was in high school I would do about 250 a day. Split that up in maybe 10 sets of 25 push ups throughout the day. Best of luck!!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Try to practice real game scenarios. Go hard and work on conditioning because in high school you will run a lot. Try 5v5s and try to join a team. It will help a lot.

You have to do things like lunges and squats on the regular (I know you might get roasted by your peers but who gives af), and also stretch your hip flexers. If you have length, use it to your advantage. I had it, so I actually went against coaches and spread my legs xtra wide (b/c they just are) to cover more ground.

Fundamentally, the best tip I can give is if you are strong in your upper body, try to absorb their drives with your chest, but keep your hands back! So long as you keep your feet square, you're in good shape. My goal personally is to make the ball handler second guess themselves, so if I know I have long arms and am contesting and they see me talking smack and bumping them out position, they will try pump fakes and different extra moves. Usually I know when to read after the first move or so that I can then jump straight up and block the shot.",,,,,,,

Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  

Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6’6” and that doesn’t hurt but he isn’t jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  

I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you’ll gain vert. It’s that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well I would say it’s normal when your still in the beginning range when it comes to dribbling. Once you start getting more adept and comfortable with dribbling basic combinations like between the legs, crossovers, in and outs, behind the back( that’s a move where u can’t look at the ball LOL)  &amp; other more skilled combinations u won’t need to look at the ball. Every expert would tell you that in a high level games like team games or even 1v1’s that u always should be able to look up. For spacial awareness, court awareness and ect. Esp team games where awareness of where your opponents and teammates are is huuuge. If you want to increase your overall b-ball I.q and be a better passer and playmaker. This is something u have to master. People who have to look down while dribbling can be a major crutch for your team.”, like missing cutters, passing lanes and other teamates who are in perfect spots to get the ball or who are open. Opponents.”, esp good defenders can easily take advantage of that and use u as a liability. Don’t get me wrong every now and again depending on the move even High level NBA and elite players would look down at the ball, sometimes it’s necessary. But being able to have the best ball control you can, training yourself to dribble without looking down will put u in the best place to be to take your game to the highest level.  Another thing that’s huge is slashing, if you want to become the best slasher u can be, then mastering dribbling without looking down is one of the first things, because watching where your defender is and countering where they move when you use dribble combinations will let you take advantage of those gaps to drive to the lane. For me I had to work on my ball control a lot to become the slasher that I am today. Esp since I was never comfortable dribbling the ball since I was a shooter. So I had to work on my weaknesses, and that was one of the first things I targeted.


I advise you to play with cones and other non moving objects while working on your drives to get better at ball control and not needing to look down when you execute combinations. Try switching in different directions while you dribble, and moves like hesitations, stopping and moving with the ball &amp; In time you won’t be doing it at all, looking up will be first nature.",,,,,,,

First major one I snapped both bones in my right forearm on my shooting arm. Had to have surgery to repair it. It was two games into the season. I had to take another redshirt year but came back a lot stronger and my junior year I was 5th in the nation in 3pt shooting %.

Also my junior year I had a partial tear in my meniscus 4 games after moving into the starting line up. Had surgery the next day and came back 10 days later and shot 16 for 20 from three point land over the next 5 games. 

My senior year I broke my toe in practice in preseason. I was able to come back to start the season. We ended up with the most wins in school history, ranked top 10 in the AP poll, won the conference tournament, and won our first round NCAA tournament game.

Injury just gives you and opportunity to slow down a bit and gives you time to work on some weaknesses and also helps you develop mental fortitude. Stay focused!",,,,,,,

Hi everyone. Before I explain my issue, here’s some information about me:

Today, I got a basketball hoop after being without one for a couple years due to moving across the country. I’m in my late teens, and I’ve grown a lot since the last time I played basketball. I’m 6’4 now, and I decided I wanted to try learning how to dunk. 

I called one of my friends who regularly plays basketball and has been trying to dunk for a while now (he’s about 6’0.5). He told me to show him my standing jump, and I was able to touch the rim (10ft hoop), but not higher. He then told me to try getting a running start to increase my vert. I did, and I kept reaching a couple inches below the rim at my peak height. Can anyone give me some tips so I can gain some inches on my running jump instead of losing a couple of inches? Thanks.

TL;DR: 6’4. Just started trying to dunk. Can touch rim on 10ft hoop with standing jump. Can’t touch rum on running jump. Can anyone give me tips on how to go higher with running jump? Thanks.

Note: My hoop is on a slight incline of about 2-3 degrees so that might affect it, but that shouldn’t make my running jump lower than my standing right?",t2_198efubb,False,,0.0,False,Standing Jump Higher than Running Jump,[],r/Basketball,False,6.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_i8rpc6,False,dark,1.0,,public,2.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},IMPROVING MY GAME,False,2.0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1597314761.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: TL;DR at bottom&lt;/p&gt;

Once you loose even a few kgs your basketball gets 10 times better. Like I lost 32 lbs (15 kg) so far and I’m sooo much better but even loosing a couple kg is all you need to greatly improve your strengths and some of your weakness. It think just working on that and shooting from mid and then soon deep should help you become better,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"*I got carried away writing this, but the gist of my comment is in* ***bold****.*   


Organized and even professional basketball is a contact sport, especially street-ball. Soon, you'll learn to love the struggle and physicality of the game and get addicted to the sensation of grabbing a highly-contested rebound or getting one on a dog of a defender. I'm not as tall as you are, but as somebody considered to be a big man where I'm from, I can only suggest that you either **nut up or shut up**.   


If you're still here and want technical advice, I suggest you **determine the type of play-style you prefer**. I understand that the trend nowadays is to be as versatile a player as you can be, but it's more logical to start with a base and go from there. You're tall in your group, but maybe not enough for formal basketball, so you can play as a point guard which means that you will want to improve your passing and dribbling. Your teammate's inadequacies cannot be helped, but, as a PG, it will be your job to find them in their high-percentage spots and give them the opening they need. Based on what you said, the defense collapses around you which means that your mates should have enough space to make a move. If you're agile enough, you might not get hurt as much since you're playing outside (although these are just my observations as somebody who regularly gets clobbered inside, I might be jaded).   


Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, **get strong**. Hit the weight room and load up on protein. No matter what you do, you will get hit in this sport. The objective of basketball as a defender is to confront the offense and prevent getting scored on. On the other hand, the objective of the offense is to confront the defense and score. Physicality is in the nature of a sport about two groups trying to defeat the other. Do not be naive and think you can avoid getting hit, there have been cases in my games where somebody would get a broken nose after getting elbowed and still keep going. That said, the goal of getting strong is not only to be able to take a hit or hit back, but to prevent and minimize the injuries you will sustain. You will have sore arms from working out, but if you fail to get stronger, you might also end up with a broken bone on top of being ineffective as a player.",,,,,,,

I don't think anything else needs to be said. I can go into detail if you want but Shaq would legitimately stand no chance against Wilt. 

I would also put Wilt at the top, when he was already old and washed up, had knee surgeries and everything he was still able to somewhat keep up with Kareem.

Jumping on the floor would be much better or working out. Essentially jumping is just outputting force/power against gravity and your own weight. 
To increase your power you need to get faster and/or stronger. Basically increasing explosiveness. There are many exercises you can do to increase explosiveness in your legs. You can do pause squats, depth jumps, running at top speed. You basically want to mix it up with exercises that are on the heavy side to gain more strength, but be doing a explosive thing at the same time, such as pause squats. You also want to be doing something that trains speed, like depth jumps or running. A mic of both will increase your vert a lot. You can search up many different types of exercises for explosiveness on YouTube. 

Lastly, you also want to make sure your form is right.

Then next you wanna measure how high you can jump and touch something. I assume you have a measuring tape, you can measure a basketball hoop and then jump and see how far up you can touch. I'm gonna again use a imaginary number and say you jumped up and touched 35 inches. 

You subtract the height you reached while standing from the height you jumped up and touched. In my example this would make you have a 15 inch vertical.

35-20=15. 

Btw of course these number wouldn't really exist unless it isn't human lol.

If you're wondering why jumping over something isn't accurate it is because you can bend your legs. Two, you are going far forward, a correct vertical would you be trying to go up as much as you can, not up and over something.",,,,,,,

When I didn’t have an adjustable goal I did it without the ball and got as high as I could on the net!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Increasing your vertical mainly comes from heavy weight leg workouts and plyometrics. Depending on your leg strength that should decide weather you should do leg workouts or plyometrics more. I think the general rule of thumb is that if your max squat is less 1.5 times your body weight, then you should focus mainly on increasing leg strength, but if it's over then you should focus more on plyometrics.

I recently changed up my leg workout to help me increase strength more effectively, and I'd recommend you do these workouts too if you want to increase leg strength and jump higher.

Squats - for overall leg strength, especially quads, Calf raises - for calves, Straight Leg Deadlifts - for hamstrings, Hip thrusts - for glutes, and split squats - kind of overalll leg strength again. You can research into doing these workouts properly. To increase strength you want higher weight and lower reps, I tend to do 4 sets of 6 reps for basically everything.

You should know also that your overall body strength is more important to jumping higher than you might realise. Particularly, a strong back and hips will help increase your vert. So deadlifts are very important.

Long story short yes squats and calf raises are important. Squats are especially important because of how much they do for your legs. Also depending on if you're a one or two foot jumper, I'd imagine calf raises would be extra beneficial if you're a single leg jumper because that jump uses your calves more.",,,,,,,

If you want to make the team you need to outplay those people in open gyms. Ask your coaches when the open gyms are at. Then go on youtube and look up ""6 keys to basketball training"" by ShotMechanics. The vid is very important. When you are training you will need to discipline yourself a lot. Always go at game speed when u train and train hard af so that the game gets easier for you. From a bball standpoint you are short so you will have to have a great bag of moves, be fast, and be a decent perimeter defender. For offense, watch Sharife Cooper, Chris Paul, Zion Harmon, Chris Lykes, IT Celtics, Jayson Tatum, Bradley Beal, Damien Lillard, CJ McCollum, Devin Booker, Trae Young, and Luka Doncic. The undersized people have the best bag imo and the rest of the people I listed also have a good moveset too. Use pickup games as a measuring gauge for what you need to work on and see if the stuff you worked on has given you results this will give you more knowledge and confidence. Only time pickup games make you better is if you are already good that way people will pass you the ball on offense and let you guard tough challenges on defense. Good luck man.",,,,,,,

Work on your timing, and you’ll gain a couple inches once your body figures out the best way to approach the rim.  

Half of dunking is getting your whole momentum upwards, but at a controlled jog.  So that’s hard, and is a skill that takes some time to learn, less so if you’re naturally athletic. 

So try to have the same routine and rhythm to your dunks, so that you’re programming your body to do it efficiently. Then later on add reverse dunks and etc.",,,,,,,

,Basketball,"First of all i'm korean so plz understand me for my poor english skills

I'm 5'11 tall and my wingspan is similar to my height i'm pretty muscular so i played as a small forward or sometimes undersize Pf when i was in high school and i'm just a amateur not a pro

Recently i participated a basketball club where guys play just for fun 

The old members asked me about my position and i said i'm sf

Then they told me i'm a bit small for a sf( normally in korea pg-5'9 sg-5'11 sf-6'1 pf-6'3 C-6'5 and above for amateurs)

And they suggested me to play as a oversize pointguard or shooting guard cuz i have height advantage as a pg and i may have problem guarding opponent sf with my size

But the problem is i'm not a 3-point shooter. my favorite spot is elbow or 0-15feet midrange shots and drive in finished with layups

And i'm 25 yrs old so i don't think i can learn to play as a guard since i played most of the games as a forward 

Do you think i should learn to play as a guard since i can have height and strength advantage? Or should i just keep playing as a forward cuz i'm used to it

Over-rated.
Don’t get me wrong.
Hear me out.
Individually, he is great and his stats state that.
Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.
Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn’t be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn’t embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that’s like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"List 1: (3 sets, 3-5 reps)

Explosive movements: rim jumps, box jumps, depth jumps

List 2: (3-4 sets, 4-8 reps)
Loaded explosive movements: jump squat, broad jumps, skiers 

List 3: 
3-4 sets, 10-20 reps:

Reactive movement: Ankle hops, line jumps


Pick an exercise off each of the lists. 

This will help build explosive power, and help your body become more reactive and more capable of converting the strength you have into vertical explosion. 

For rest periods that will depend on you. Your objective should be to be fully recovered before each set for anything off list 1, it's about exploding off the group with maximum power for each rep. That's also why reps are so low there. Similar sort of goes for list 2, however you don't really want to be resting for 3+ minutes or anything like that for those. 

List 3 exercises can have lower rest. Like 1-2 minutes

For rep count, if you notice the quality of your reps diminishing significantly, or for things on list 1 basically at all, then that means your set is over. That's what exercises on list 2 and 3 are for. You want to hit it full power, full performance, so as to keep expanding the power you can exert. 

-

Core strength will also help you a lot, preferably exercises in the lower rep range. So not doing 50 crunches, more like 10-15 leg lifts. Pick 3-4 exercises for 3-4 sets and try to really hit them with full reps

Luckily abs recover pretty quickly, so you can basically almost work them out every day if you want.",,,,,,,

The above thing would be tailored to basketball and you don't have to use a mirror, but can just imagine the thoughts you want to yourself or say them before a game in a low voice to yourself.  This can only be effective if and when you have the moves and the talent to do something against whomever you're playing against.  You can't psyche yourself up to beat kawhi leonard unless you're on his level, but as far as psyching yourself up to play fearlessly and up to your potential, it works.  You still need to practice and be good at whatever your role is on the court.  Get a friend of yours to play you 1 on 1, but let him foul you or play very rough, so you won't be rattled when a defender does it.  And again, if your defender is just in another class above you, no amount of thinking is gonna change that, so be realistic.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Try to make your defender move before you even dribble ( jab steps, pump fakes etc. ) and see how he reacts. If he falls for your fakes easily then its simple, just do a jab step or a pump fake and drive but if that doesent work try to fake him out by dribbling ( hesitations and stuff ) If the defender doesent react so easily then that usually means he is a good defender ( of course if he just stands there and doesent do nothing you can just shoot or even drive ) 
But if hes good then you need to use more ball protective moves like spin moves, post fades or just passing it to your teammate. I always keep these in mind because it helps me focus and not get nervous when a defender squares me up because i know what to do.",,,,,,,

Because if someone squares you up, they’re playing good defense and you’re not the offense’s best option

Secondly, usually people will start ball watching in this situation because it looks like it’s going to be a 1-on-1 possession. This means smart off-ball players will cut and be open.",,,,,,,

Taking a shot just normally created fewer turnovers than driving and getting into trouble. You can get away with some things at lower levels but as you go up you have to adjust.",,,,,,,

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week I’ve been icing much more and I always stretch before I play . My concern is that if I let up and stop playing / working out I will lose all my jumping “progress” . I’m now 25 and weigh about 185lbs . Any advice is appreciated. I’m desperate .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Idk if it’s worth mentioning but I also work a pretty physically demanding job.&lt;/p&gt;

Rest is also important.  i went from 4-6 days a week to 2 days a week with ice/rest in between.  that and losing 10 poounds helped me a ton.

Then at the power forward position, it becomes important to find the space around the perimeter and get your feet set and ready to shoot. Try to focus on keeping your balance. A lot of times after you pop you are moving laterally and it is difficult to shoot with good balance. Same situation for after setting a back screen, or rotating to the corner after a drive. All your momentum is going a different direction and you need to use your feet to transfer it toward the basket to shoot consistently. 

For starters, when practicing shooting, use the same footwork every time. Whatever is most comfortable for you, a hop, left-right, or right-left. Getting your balance consistent will help you knock them down when you are open. In addition to your deep game, being able to attack the rim with one or two dribbles (after a shot fake or head fake) is another great skill to work on and will make you a lot tougher to defend. I wouldn't bother with too much mid-range practice. Mindset should be shoot from 3 or get the ball to the paint.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"First as a parent of kids who are currently sitting out from joining their bball team and as an AAU coach, let me say your parents are making the right call.

  Playing organized sports is a huge risk right now.
 It is tough to sit out especially if other people or your team has decided to start backup again. But you should recognize that your health is very important.

 As a 15 year old you should continue to work on ball handling regardless of your height or position.
 Hopefully you have space somewhere in your house or near your house where you can really push yourself to increase your dribbling speed and work on adding more dribbling ball handling moves to your bag.

If ya have a hoop yup work on that shooting.
Do 100 free throws a day.

Also you're at the age where you really should work on Ploymetric and cardio strength training.

 Doing simple exercises such as squats, calf raises, push UPS and jumping jacks are easy ways to not only stay in shape but also challenge your body to develop muscles in the proper places for bball.

 Honestly there are so many great YouTube channels right now that are making Bball training videos for people who can't go to the gym.

 In terms of confidence 1st rely on the fact that you know you have been able to score proficiently in games.

Strength and hypertrophy are obviously related, but not always, and there are different lifting programs that are designed to emphasize each aspect.

My suggestions for a beginner is to keep your lifts basic, your weight low (bodyweight if you’re just beginning), research or find a trainer to teach you how to perform the lifts with proper form (especially compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and even bench presses and military presses if you want to avoid injury), and eat more if your focus is on gaining weight.",,,,,,,

Also, get lower, spread your feet a bit wider and jump harder into that takeoff. Also, don't square up to the rim completely, takeoff at an angle.
    
This is close to what I'm talking about. Compare that takeoff to yours and you'll see the difference.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Copying a previous answer of mine with some tweaks) 

Based off your elevation, I would say you need ~2-3 inches to get your first dunk, probably from someone throwing it up for you or you bouncing it really high. However at ~4-5 inches I see you as very comfortably being able to dunk 1 foot or 2 foot when fully stretched out with one hand. To gain these inches, I would suggest looking up some online vert workout videos. I personally used the combo of Andrew Lloyd and Isaiah Rivera's YouTube videos (The first for strength, the second for stretches and plyometrics). You should see really good results by ~7 weeks if not sooner. Another important key is your jump technique as I see you kind of slow down near the end which isn't ideal, Isiah can really help with that as well.

Tl;Dr: You need 4-5 inches to get dunking by yourself, I would suggest watching Andrew Lloyd and Isiah Rivera for workouts.

Be sure to ask if you need any more help",,,,,,,

Explosive deadlifts if you're an advanced athlete, ONLY if you actually know how to deadlift, otherwise you will destroy your body.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and if you have tips I would love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

-Spot Shots 5 from 3 and 5 from mid 5x10 makes each 
-Driving from the 3 point line 2x10 each side 
-Bagwork (Tyler relph) 
-finish with either games or sprints and work on simple dribbling drills as well 
And if you want to jump higher lifting or adding resistance is the only way to do that calisthenics should be incorporated into your workout also",,,,,,,

I first start by running ten laps around while dribbling the ball 5 laps left hand 5 laps right hand. Then I start my dribbling drills by dribbling really low around my feet in a circle 10 reps each hand. I then move on to shooting I have to make 10 swish shots at the free throw line the 5 shots at the 3 point line. After that I go to my local gym a lift weights for about an hour mainly focusing on my biceps then I start doing my daily workout. 30 to 40 crunches, 40 push ups, 50 sit ups, and finally 30 burpees. I hope this helps you in any way and good luck.",,,,,,,

Especially given that's a wide ""average."" Maybe it's conceivable in some super shitty rec league because every semi decent or better player doesn't play rec but is on an aau team.

Most 8th grade games are 6 or 7 minute quarters, so you're looking at 24-28 minutes for one game. Usually the highest scoring teams average around 55 points a game. 

JV as a freshman isn't bad  Usually a player in your situation will be a two year varsity player with a shot at starting as a senior. I'm surprised they would put you on JV though if you're not getting any run rather than put you on the freshman team to get experience.

If you're still not getting much playing time as season progresses, I'd talk to the coach and see if you could split time between jv and freshman",,,,,,,

That means lots and lots of reps.  but pretty much anyone who puts in the time will see improvements, drastic if you really dedicate to it.

1000 dribbles every day is a good early benchmark.  broken down by:

100 left hand mid height (to the knee)

50 left hand low (below the knee)

50 left hand high (above the waist)

100 right hand mid height (to the knee)

50 right hand low (below the knee)

50 right hand high (above the waist)

\*\* Do this twice with each hand (800 dribbles total)

50 wide crossovers (outside the knees)

50 shallot crossovers (inbetween the knees)

\*\* do this twice for 200 dribbles

Do that for 30 days, then come back for more.  EXTREMELY important to be in a squated/knees bent position and to keep your head up not look at the ball.

Dont worry about speed yet.  focus on accuracy and control.  speed will come.

Do workouts that focus on balance. One legged exercises (squatting up and down). Vibration plates.

* Footwork.  If its a turn around the footwork to get your weight into the defender and spin back the other way is critical.  Off the dribble into a step back again the lead foot plant back into the fade is important.
* Balance.  Many who use the fade away dont focus on being balanced and it drastically effects the results.  Just because the shot is leaning backwards doesnt mean you need to be completely off balance.  footwork will help, but practice being squared to the rim is vital.

Reps reps reps reps.  get your footwork and form consistent.  using a buddy helps as the fade away is alot about using your body and creating space.  putting your weight on a defender to create space then squaring as you elevate",,,,,,,

Well I want to ask first, is your ball handling with both hands pretty good? Because doing any type of hesitation move requires great ball control/ball manipulation. If you have that I’ll give you some pointers. To do hesis you must sell it with your eyes. If you’re doing a hesi where you hang the ball on your hand for a sec, you look at the opposite direction of where the ball is currently in your hand. So if it’s on your left hand you look to the right then explode left. Your right foot will be the one pushing off with your left foot being a forward. You get what I’m saying? That’s one type of hesitation but you get the point. Also, having a good core helps. I forgot what the video was but I remember someone saying that having a good core is a must when looking to become a faster ball handler. I can attest to this because I notice when I’m doing a stationary workout where I’m doing hard pounds, I can literally feel my core working. Hope this helps. If you have more questions I’ll answer.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're talking about a shot hesitation, then a lot of core work is in order. If you're talking about a hesi cross, then you need to first sell it with your eyes, shift your body and shoulders to the side you're taking to, get low, then plant your lead foot so I can explosively go by your defender in the opposite direction.",,,,,,,

Your on the right track but your routine isnt quite enough.  I'd also focus more on reps and less on time.  that will push you more:  


Left handed dribble low (below knee) x50

Left handed mid dribble (knee height) x50

Left handed high dribble (waist height) x50

Left handed high dribble (waist height) x50

Left handed mid dribble (knee height) x50

Left handed dribble low (below knee) x50

&amp;#x200B;

Then do that same ladder with the right hand.  thats 600 dribbles.  Focus on control, not speed.  speed will come. Do that 3 times a day.  Dont worry about crossovers until youve done this for 1 month.  Your will be less likely to develop poor form on crossovers once your left/right muscle memory builds.  


After 1 month add in crossvers. 

50 wide just outside the knees, mid height

50 shallow between the knees, mid height

50 low, between the knees, low height

Repeat 4 times for 600 dribbles

After a month add in V-dribbles and in and out dribbles.  same as right/left alternating low/mid/high.  600 dribbles.

Then add 2 ball.  50 times low/mid/high synchronized bounce.  then low mid high alternating bounce.",,,,,,,

As far as drills, dont necessarily worry about scoring. Yeah, it's cool and all, but coaches need role players too. You can't beat anyone if you cant play defense. So I'd suggest focus on the rebounding and scoring drills. If you score some points along the way, great. It's a bonus. 

I've seen players have poor tryouts and make the team because of intangibles. I've seen kids have the best tryout in their life only to quit the team later. CONTROL WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL and dont compare yourself to anyone else. That kid might be a fuck up in school or whatever and not make it anyway! Best of luck to you.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When I was 13, I was a 5’9 PG w potential. Won 2nd place in a district tournament so we were decent. Then I went to HS, and made freshmen for a good HS in a basketball state. I didn’t play much that year. I didn’t hustle. I stopped showing up to practice. I joined AAU and summer teams and somehow got ranked locally. The talent was there. The hustle wasn’t.

I got cut my second year and never made it back. I tried transferring schools and that didn’t work.

It’s my ONLY regret in life but I’ve learned so much about that period in time. I’m in my 30s today and enjoy a successful life but always think back to that moment. What if? 

So don’t make my mistake. Want tips? Here are a few of mine:

1. conditioning is key. Can you run 10 minute miles? That’s just a start. But start timing your runs and see how long it takes to run 3, 4, and 5 miles. This is only to start training your mind to stay engaged after a long run. Basketball is about sprints however so throw those in as well.

2. attitude is everything. Ask questions when you can. Prove to your coaches that you’re there to learn. The more you’ll learn, the more you’ll realize you don’t know so skip the painful lessons now and just recognize that you’re about to (hopefully) embark on this long and wonderful journey. Have a good attitude.

3. Don’t “shoot around.” You have to practice in game scenarios at full effort/speed. There’s an app called Home Court and tons of YouTube trainers. These drills will help you know what to practice which was what I struggled with at your age.

If basketball is something you’re serious about and you can make the commitment, I’d be happy to pay for a year of Home Court. Just gotta promise me you’ll give it your best. Good luck, kid. And no matter what, find something you love (basketball or not), and don’t give up.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Communicate on offence and defence a lot, play hard on both ends at all times, and listen closely to the directions the coach(es) are giving.

Try to move the ball, avoid creating turnovers or over dribbling and getting yourself into trouble. People that play outside themselves or gamble can be effective, but if it doesn't work then it can look really bad.

If you can do some conditioning in the lead up to tryouts that's always a good thing. If you can go out and out work those around you then a coach will always love it, will also make it easier for you to focus on yourself.

Also, just play confident. You know yourself, do what you're comfortable doing and play your game. At the end of the day the decision isn't yours, so don't stress too much, it is what it is.",,,,,,,

Check your ego and ball hogging. The best players on the playground are there cuz they're not on the team.

Make sure you're hydrated before tryouts ( just a good idea in general tbh).  It' will do a lot for endurance, especially later into scrimmages etc.

Good luck.",,,,,,,

Even if you lack talent or size, if you’re athletic and give it your 110% on every possession, it makes a good impression on the coaches. Also, find a gym that your coach may frequent, whether that be a private gym or your schools gym, and get in and work on your game. This has two positive effects: You’re getting better, and your potential coach sees that you have a work ethic.

This goes without saying, but make sure that all your fundamentals are solid. If you can’t make your layups or dribble without turning the ball over, no matter how conditioned you are, you probably won’t make the team.",,,,,,,

The most important thing to me is to be the best version of you there is. All of your best qualities, as a player and a person, should be on display not only in the gym, but in school as well. I want the best players my district has, but have cut kids who didn't fit our team's culture even though they were good enough to make the team. Not everyone believes in my approach. But, I'll keep a good kid who's slightly worse over a kid who's a jerk to people around him. Character matters.

Do not try to do things you don't do well because you want to impress the coaches with what you know. I want to see what you do that helps our program win, no matter what level. Show me what you do well.

Be in shape. If I haven't seen you before in the junior high levels, my staff is going to work you hard. We need to see if it's a glamour project for you or if you are serious about being on the team.

You will make mistakes. We don't mind that. Frankly, I want to see kids make mistakes because I want to see how you respond after that. If you get beat on defense, do you sulk? Do you take a bad shot to try to get a bucket to make up for the one you gave up? Or, do you let it go and worry about the next possession?",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a former coach, if you want to make a team, regardless of your strengths and skill level make sure you are doing these things with no exception:

* Be on time, be attentive, be prepared (have your gear on, shoes tied, be in line, etc).
* Play hard.  Hustle.  get after loose balls.  work as hard as you can on defense.  Coaches especially at the high school level want guys who bring intensity and defend.
* Pass.  Make the right plays.  pass up an ok shot for a great shot for a teammate.  Coaches want guys who will run the offense and elevate others
* Be encouraging to others.  if someone misses a shot  or gets beat be loud with words of encouragement.  coaches want good players but also want good teammates.

Your shot may or may not go in.  we all have cold spells.  you may turn it over, we all get sloppy.  you may get beat, we all get taken to the hoop.  but those 4 things about are 100% in your control and will catch EVERY coaches eye.

2. Have a plan and stick to it: People show up to the gym for a shooting workout and just start chucking shots at the rim. The best improvement I made on my jumper came from planning exactly what I wanted to do. Starting with a hand-eye coordination warm-up, them progressing to a form-shooting warm-up, then continuing to spot up shooting drills.

3. Make your reps count: Shooting for the sake of shooting isn’t gunna make you a better shooter. If you ever shoot until you feel too exhausted to get in proper reps, it’s time to call it quits and end the workout.

4. If you haven’t found your form, tweak it till you do: Took me a while to find my form, but a simple elbow tweak to make my arm straighter towards the rim made a night &amp; day difference",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You have to warm up correctly before playing - every single time.  Show up early if you need to.  When practicing you also warm up and then find yourself around a half dozen spots on the floor and shoot from only those spots.  Just make sure you get your numbers in at each spot.  The spots many people shoot from are the corner 3 and about 15 foot along the baseline.  Then there is the top of the key and free throw line shot.  Then there is the free throw line extended 3.  That's pretty much it. You can allot maybe 30 minutes to an hour.  I'd start out trying at least 20 shots per spot. I normally did 50-100 per spot.  But I had to be a really good shooter to get to play.  Track your progress.  Also track your time.  Great shooters are born. They can roll out of bed and hit 10 threes in a row right off the bat.   You can watch them play for a year and not see them miss two shots in a row.  The remaining 98% of us have to practice every day to remain competitive.,,,,,,,

Speak to your coach in private. Any coach who's a decent human being makes time for their players. Ask them why you got benched. After the explanation, ask them if this is an area you can improve upon, and if that effort or adjustment can get your playing time back. 

If your coach gives you an answer you dont like, come back to me. Sometimes there's ""coach code"" where they say one thing and mean another. But dont pout and bitch and moan. Be the best teammate you can be. It all adds up",,,,,,,

Coaches, especially at lower levels (JV, Highschool, AAU) are less worried about skill/scoring and more about buying into the team concept, defending, playing hard, and playing within the offense/team concept.  


Attitude is also important.  are you sulking?  talking back?  being a dick to teammates?  Making excuses.

Also, ASK!  Your coach knows the reason, ask him.  be honest and be modest.  to be combative or make excuses.  some coaches are stubborn but they all want to win and make you a better player.  ask him why your playing time was reduced and how you can earn those minutes back.  then work hard to show him you respond well to feedback.  


It may just be tough love.  maybe the coach sees more potential from you and that it comes too easy for you so you dont need to push yourself so he is manufactoring hardship for you to overcome.  


But be positive.  even if he is negative.  learn from it.  ask him, take his advice and work and you'll be playing again",,,,,,,

It's not going to be the equivalent of a random Thursday night League Pass game.

But yes, the 90s were a great time for the NBA's popularity. Not only did you have superstars that were a huge departure from the 80s style in Shaq, MJ, Penny, etc, but I think the league took a huge step forward culturally, especially in marketing itself to kids. Think of the impact NBA Jam had. It definitely took a dip after Jordan's final year with the Bulls and continued probably until Lebron's Cavs 1.0 teams were NBA Finals level goods. The early and mid 2000s seems like a black hole of one-on-one ball, low scoring, and criminal records. It was a sad state of affairs that late round playoff games were played in the 70s and 80s.

You can have your personal preferences towards the 90s, but I like where the NBA is now.  The players have adapted to stricter fouling rules. No more can teams win by simply out-strengthing the opposition. The skill level is through the roof today. Positionless basketball has opened the door for skill and strategy to take over. I like that it is now the norm for teams to combine for 200 - 250 points per game.",,,,,,,

If you spend 2-3 months getting stronger doing Squats, Barbell Hip Hinges and Deadlifts, while stretching every single day, opening your glutes, and hip flexors, then stopping strength training for a while and doing plyometrics, practice jumps, and sprints, you should be able to see some results.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s all about efficient energy transfer. You don’t have to be Popeye the Sailor to shoot jumpers. Some tips on efficiently shooting a basketball:

1. Keep your entire body loose but poised. Any stiffness will sap away energy while shooting. 

2. Do not stop the ball while bringing it from your set point to your shooting form. You wouldn’t stop swinging a golf club right before it hits the ball, then strike it from a stop, right? So when shooting a basketball keep the momentum going and make it one swift, fluid motion.

3. Don’t lean forward too much. Keep your back comfortably upright, but tip your body forward (oxymoron, I know) ever so slightly so the weight is on the balls of your feet. Now when your bend your legs a bit and jump, your body will be straight and all the force your apply to the ground will bounce right back to propel you up (Newton’s third law)

4. A short but springy jump is better than a long-winded and weak jump. Don’t bend your legs too much, but once it’s bended jump with a powerful force. Time this brief but strong jump with your upper body release. This way your jump takes as much time as your release but still contributes a large impulse (impulse = time * force. To get the same impulse as a long-winded jump, you gotta shorten the time and increase the force. A smaller knee bend helps

5. Finally, practice! Muscle memory will power your shot more than any amount of time in the weight rooms. I’ve never pumped iron seriously on my life but I went from airballing free throws to hitting 3 pointers off the dribble just by practicing a ton. You can do it too",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’ve always been a good shooter but it took me about 4 years from when I started practicing it to get there. The main secret is confidence in your shot, take the shot because you know you’ll make it not because you can. But the basic things I can tell you is shoot everyday till you’re to tired to shoot, try working from 300 shots a day to 500 and keep going up. Pick different spots on the court and shoot 20-30 reps from each spot and pick 10-15 spots a session. Practice “game shots” like pull up jumpers, shooting coming around a pick, creating jump shots off only 3 dribbles, pick spots around the 3 pt line and do 30-45 reps in each spot. I’ve practiced with some friends that played college ball who had great strokes and they would make me practice shooting from 10 feet out to build my strength up. You have to familiarize yourself and build muscle memory from every distance/angle/situation/location on the court so that you can always find yourself in a well practiced position. 
This is all assuming that you have your firm down. Not every video on shooting form works for everyone because not everyone’s jump shots will look the same. I picked my favorite shooters to watch and learned from them watching YouTube and games. I learned good base and foundation for my shoot from MJ and Kobe/ I took my follow through and flick from JJ reddick and ray allen/ and I tried to practice all of it until I could shoot with a release as quick as Reggie miller’s and ray allens. 
But the basic guideline is BEEF- “Base” / “Elbow”/ “Elbow”/ “Follow Through” 

It’s such a great feeling when you’re the best shooter on the court",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I remember when I was really young still shooting from my chest. I watched nba players and college players shoot over their head. Made the switch at like 9 or 10 and it’s been an ongoing battle ever since to find the perfection in it. Tweak after tweak. Break from basketball after break from basketball. I’ve had super hot stretches and super bullshit stretches. Muscle memory is important. Try not to take stretches without shooting for too long.,,,,,,,

After I had the correct form, it was all about repetition...a LOT of it. Like, I don't think you can fully realize the amount of shooting I did as a kid.

The other thing is the amount of shooting I did in close. Everybody in the world wants to bomb from the cheap seats, but it's the fundamentals you get from shooting close in that will guide you to deeper success. My favorite drill? Play ""Around the World"" from 3 ft away and see how many swishes you can get in a row while making SURE you hold your follow-through every shot. This drill sounds dumb but I promise you it isn't.

Your jumpshot is all about form. If you're starting out with poor form, it will only get worse as you increase your range. Your legs and your core will help you extend your distance, so be sure to focus on your bottom half when strength training.

Once you have the basics down, then you have to get the mental side of the game down pat. What do I mean? I mean confidence. How to get open. When to shoot. We could spend hours discussing this aspect of the game. You want to dominate pick-up games? Learn how to shoot quickly and and in rhythm off of L-Cuts, starting from the block on each side under the hoop, hitting the FT line, then 90 degrees straight out to the wing. You catch the rock just as you're facing the hoop and let it fly. You learn this from both sides and you're near unstoppable.",,,,,,,

If anyone would like tips let me know! I think I can do a decent job of explaining what drills and stuff I did to get my form down well, because I did a lot of research and personal experimenting in order to get it to a point where I feel good. I haven’t practiced as nearly as much as some people here so one thing I will say about my form is every couple minutes during practices or shooting for fun, I consciously remember to check my form: foot placement and leg position, hand position, and my elbow angle.",,,,,,,

For all of high school I could not figure out why I couldn't shoot consistently. I was just never a threat in game. I always thought it was my stroke. I could get hot in practice or shootaround alone on short jumpers but that didn't help. 

It's not until I finally found Pro Shot Shooting System on YouTube that went over every individual mechanic of your body in shooting a basketball and even matched that with how current NBA shooters shot.

I learned all the myths and all the right mechanics and after I incorporated the mechanics I needed, I INSTANTLY became a good shooter.

If you decide you only will take 3's and nothing else, you are not a threat to score in other ways, teams will defend you much tighter at the 3, and then youre forcing up bad looks at the basket.

You say ""if you hit 30% from beyond the ark"" then why not just shoot from 3 point line? That ""if"" statement is everything wrong with your proposition. Your percentages and efficiency doesnt dictate how the game flows, its the game that dictates your percentages.

I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. 







It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play.

A lot of people get bad ankle and knee injuries from the impacts of landing so working on your landing will help avoid those injuries as much as possible.

If you're landing properly, that is adequately absorbing the impact of the descent of your jump, you'll find you have to activate more muscles in your legs to stabilize everything. Once you're body gets used to using these muscle fibres to land, they'll also be more available for when you take off. The more muscle fibres you can recruit, the more strength and power your muscles have available, leading to high jumps.

TLDR; you should focus on your landing because it will help reduce the risk of injury and will also help recruit more muscle fibres, which will make you jump higher.",,,,,,,

Keep jumping more that's the key to higher vert but along with jump you should focus on other stuffs like your form, landing, stretching, mobility and flexibility, core strength and also other recovery protocols

When you jump you are using muscles from many parts of your body all together. However, when you continue to jump with just your bodyweight, your legs cannot evolve past that weight. If you add more resistance, then your legs will become strong enough to explosively lift more than just your bodyweight, thereby increasing your vert.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Father Time is undefeated, but athletic decline after 30 is overblown. You can still maintain or improve your strength and conditioning levels with intelligent training. Likewise, you can still improve your skillset and sport intelligence. Those two factors should more than make up for any athletic decline due to advanced age, resulting in either same or improved overall sport performance.

Also, ""decline after 30"" is mostly narrative-driven, and not strongly supported by research. There is probably an inflection point at which athleticism begins to decline, but given interpersonal differences in training history, genetics, and skill, it's nearly impossible to point to 1 point in time where everything goes downhill, and really, not worth worrying about.

In fact, that narrative is probably more harmful than any biological changes. Think about everything you hear relating to age and performance. ""It's over after 30,"" ""Your body just breaks down/isn't the same,"" ""Stretch, you'll be glad when you're older."" That's a powerful nocebo - you expect to feel worse after 30, so you do. When in reality, there's no measurable difference between the day before and day after your 30th birthday.

The overall decline matters for elite athletes, where every fraction of a second is magnified because everyone is a goddamn freak of nature. But even then, we are now seeing NBA athletes extend their careers well into their 30s.

So, what should you do? Stop spreading the myth of ""decline after 30."" It's not true (not in any meaningful way), and it's a harmful narrative for you and your friends. 

Just go about your business and continue to kick ass and take names. Keep training, keep competing with the expectation of excellence. Better nutrition is probably a good idea (limit processed foods, red meats, sat fats, eat lots of fruits and veggies). Resistance training has tons of health benefits, beyond sport performance. Cardio is good too. You can never be too fit.

Eventually Father Time will catch up, but that's out of your control anyway. Between now and then, there's plenty of basketball to be played.",,,,,,,

But your DIET is where you might get killed. The stresses that come with getting a career off the ground or raising children as well as the peer pressure of imbibing in your social life will have you ending up with a spare tire. It's so easy to fall into a rut and start eating too much processed food because it's simple and quick.

I'm 34, been married seven years and have two children under the age of 3. At my worst weight, I was about 224 at 5'11"". In May I was at 209 which I was not at all satisfied with. There's a court with a 9.5 foot basket that I could barely dunk on one handed. We actually started Weight Watchers back then and I'm down to 192 and can sneak in some two hand dunks on that hoop.",,,,,,,

As stated above your age is going to be more of a factor to others than yourself. 

If you continuously strengthen your mind and strengthen your body... it is up to YOU to determine how much is enough. That’s a huge responsibility. Practicing. Recovering. Eating. Etc. You have to ask yourself how bad you want it. 

Let’s say I play a game against a majority of 23 year olds... it is not their age that gives them the advantage AT ALL. It is the skill. 

Take Cristiano Ronaldo for example he too is 36 and his trainers say they can see him competing until his 40s. 

Where are you at mentally?! This ain’t for anyone else to determine. This is for you to determine!

How important is it to you? If it is you’ll always make it happen. If it isn’t you’ll make excuses.

Athleticism: Try out plyometrics. This will increase your vertical jump and improve your first step to get past defenders and to the hoop.

Ball Handling: Really the best thing to do is to overload. Dribble with two balls instead of one. This will improve your handles with both hands and make it easier to dribble with one ball. Steph Curry's warmup routine is a great example of this.

Shooting: Try Steve Nash's 20 minute shooting workout.

Finishing: Work on acrobatic layups, since your a point guard, centers will have it easy blocking you unless you find a way to manipulate the ball in midair.

Perimeter defense: Try resisted Sliding, and strengthening your core. This will enable to change direction fast and stay in front of your defender.",,,,,,,

Also if you can find yourself some bleachers and an open field high intensity/explosive sprints and running up and down the bleachers will help tremendously.

Sounds like a lot, but it takes a lot.",,,,,,,

The next aspect is your jumping form correcting your jump form alone can give your 3 4 inches in gain instantly. 

And also focus of other recovery protocols, core strength, flexibility and mobility and jumping regularly these are few stuffs many avoid and don't focus on

An interior force, athletic, fast, everything you want from a big man. He was a great shot blocker and a great scorer. THe main reason why people don't think of him as one of the greatest is because of the status of the NBA at that point of time. 

Back then, the NBA only had so many teams, and because of that, not many people were there to match up with Wilt. Basically Wilt had it easy. But when you look at players like Michael Jordan, they had a lot to deal with. (Charles Barkley, Gary Payton, Magic Johnson etc.). When a player has that much struggle, and still manages to put up great scoring, passing, rebounding, and defensive numbers, they will for sure get into the top three.\\

Don't ""present"" the ball to them by dribbling in front of your body - only when doing fast crossovers. So you do some transverse (not directly to the basket but in the right direction) dribble to one side while covering the ball with your body, then a crossover and then you repeat the same thing on the other side with the other hand until you are near the basket for an easy throw, lay up, hook or any post move. 

This doesn't look flashy or utterly skilled but it gets the job done and forces the defender to play REAL defense and not just random steals. Since I am not a small and fast player I have been relying on this for many years now and I usually win my 1vs1 matches.

If you are the small/fast guy you probably have to get even faster, dribble the ball lower and have to change the rhythm of your dribbles (varying speed and bounce height of the ball) so that you are less predictable. Either way, covering the ball is crucial to prevent steals.",,,,,,,

 In the  USA AAU is a basketball league for young people (8yr old to 18).

 It is considered generally the league where are you can find the highest level of youth competition and basketball.
 Its main function yes obviously besides making money off of parents who swear their kids are going to get drafted in the NBA tomorrow,  Is to provide kids an opportunity to compete in basketball that is outside of their school or local club team both of which typically do not offer elite competition.

 For high school students kids age 14 through 18 it has become an almost required path if you were actually trying to obtain D1 college scholarship.

However  it is possible to just play on your high school team and still get AD1 scholarship- most likely to your local college but not any top tier bball college (Duke, Kentucky etc) 
But this would mean you would not get national exposure and you'd have to be really really dominant on your high school team playing other dominant high school teams.
 And if that is the case in the United States trust me AAU coaches will be pushing hard to that kid's parents to join their team.

 I'm sure others will get into the bashing of AAU believe me its organization full of humans. So you can expect it to be filled with politics, drama, money grabbing behaviors and misguided agendas.
 But once the whistle blows it's the place to go to high competitive basketball for any age school students",,,,,,,

I doubt high tops really provide any protection against ankle sprains. The idea that high-tops provide ankle support is more a mental thing. A brace could stabilize your ankle and stop it from over rotating. Get a brace with medical advice.

And remember, bones heal slowly in the late 30s. So be very mindful of what you do on the court. Don't go all out unless you are sure your ankle can take it. And always be mindful of where you land when you jump...

All my ankle sprains are from people getting their feet in my landing spots.",,,,,,,

You should wear an ankle brace for months after your ankles feel healed. This is probably more important for you because you’ve had a worse injury than me. I’ve had a few ankle sprains before and once you injure them once, you’re more prone to aggravations. Even though his ankle problems are mostly behind him, Stephen Curry is probably going to be wearing ankle braces for the rest of his career. He’s a good example.",,,,,,,

If you are a reasonably athletic forward you likely have a speed/quickness advantage on the bigger players defending you.

So, offensively I would advise improving your ball handling as is a skill that is useful no matter what.  If you can also improve your perimeter shooting (3pt shot?) then you can be a very tough guard for a big man.

You make your defender (likely their big) choose to either:
1. Sag off of you on the perimeter, and then you can bury open 3pt shots and run pick and pop action.
2. Step out to guard you on the perimeter and you go by your defender  on the dribble.

I would also advise you to focus on your free throw shooting.  If you become a mismatch offensively for teams they may be forced to play zone.  Most zone offenses attempt to attack the FT line.  Plus improving your foul shooting is never a bad thing.

Good luck!",,,,,,,

When you’re out there on offense try to stay aware of where your teammates are and make sure you aren’t too close to anyone because you could mess up the spacing depending on what you’re team is doing. When you get the ball only do moves that you’re comfortable with. Only shoot when you’re open and pass when you notice someone is open or will be. Drive when you think you have a clear lane to the basket. On defense, stay with your man and try to always stay in front of the basket relative to who you’re guarding. When you’re guarding your man, especially on ball, don’t ever swipe at their wrists/arms. Only aim for the ball if you want to steal or block them.",,,,,,,

I think your first priority should be to make sure you can do a leg day, back day, and chest day. For example I have a rack that I can both squat AND bench press from so that helps a LOT. I have a machine that allows me to do several back exercises and a chest one. It's really helpful too. You can do a lot with dumbbells.

Anything else is gravy but investing in good plyometric training would be the next priority IMO.

Don't do shit like using your phone and checking the latest pornhub video. Not saying pick up is bad but you must do the dirty work that is boring. Pickup is good when you have a new move or when you just learnt how to consistently shoot and want to implement it. Just fucking grind on a empty court no matter how boring it might be and keep on doing it. Occasionally playing pick up is fine maybe 2 days of pickup and the rest of the week just grind.

Watch the whole video. Playing pickup doesnt realky help as much as people say. Lot of the time spent is waiting to get a turn. When u do get a turn people wont pass u the ball if they dont trust u to do anything good on offense and if the guy in front of you doesnt get the ball and just stands in one spot u cant practice defense. Also in pickup people will half ass so when u get to tryouts or real games you wont be able to do anything effective b/c u havent trained for it. A guy I went to school with that was top 100 on all major recruting sites told me that he trained for 1 hr and half a day sometimes 2. He played pickup on occassion but only with people that were ""real hoopers"". You will know that u have improved when playing gets easier for u and people will compliment u as well. Like finsihed tough layups with ur off hands, dribbling thru heavy traffic at a fast speed with ur off hand, hit more contested shots or deep shots. Compliments will just be people saying ""youre raw, you got a strap"" or whatever the slang is where u live. If you want moves to work on I advise watching basketball at all levels tho. Like eybl, adidas gaunlet, or underarmour association (high school aau), college basketball, and nba.

Or getting to the bucket more often  or less?  Successful dribbling by defenders, less turnovers? .. if you don’t ever feel on fire than you’re likely not getting any better. 
Try to get in pickup games where the team or guys your playing are clearly better than you. That’s the best way to get better cause you don’t have a choice if ya wanna win. 
Tbh, this is just my opinion but I’d rather have a guy who has 15 assists and 10 point. My point is, if a guy can hit shots  and takes 5 and hits 5, takes 7 hits 7, but has craeated 35-40 points off good passes and distribution, that’s more valuable to me than a guy who ball hogs constantly, goes 15/25 with 4 assists. Smart shots are always good shots.. 

Also, everything you do with the right, do with left in terms of warming up and training. 10 on each side  right hand left hand, if you practice crossing left make sure you practice right... I know this sounds like common sense but you’d be surprised how many people don’t do this. Especially with dribbling.",,,,,,,

If basketball were played like women played it in the 70-80's we could break down the metrics of offense and defensive players.

- Janice(defense only) scores 0pts with two assist, 10 rebounds, 4 blocked shots and 1 steal.

Men's basketball was always played the way it's played today, but they're offensive specialist and defensive specialist. 
All I ever hear from younger guys is, ""I'm not getting better cause I didn't score enough points.""

That was a breakthrough for me - aggressive is not scoring points, it is enabling the team to score - any fucking way possible. I became a good and willing screener despite not being too huge. Passing quick. Boxing out and sprinting back. Those became my pride points and I found the pleasure I thought I lost when I misplaced my jump shot (lol). 

So maybe accept who you are, focus on defense and do the little things most played hate on offense. It is a rewarding way to think about basketball. I live it personally, being a glue guy, the blue-collar asshole on offense.",,,,,,,

Edit: Also forgot to mension that you shouldnt be afraid of asking for the ball, even if you miss a shot or turn over the ball your temates wont be mad at you, trust me its better to mess up a play than to just stand on the court and do nothing for the entire game.",,,,,,,

Now bend your knees a little bit to get a solid stance. 3. Make sure that you put good pressure when bouncing the basketball to prevent opponents from intercepting it. 4. Always do your moves as low as you possibly can, because if you did it really high that would be stolen from you. So you your crossover low and if you can, your between the legs. 5. Always keep your head up, if you just look down and just focus on the ball then again you’re not focusing on your opponent he can steal again. So make sure your head is up to focus on your opponent.

,Basketball,"Increasing vertical

Hey, I was looking for some guidance on increasing my vertical. Right now I can dunk by palming the ball, (6’6) however I get rim stuffed when I dunk while cradling the ball and dunking, I literally just need ~2 inches to get up there since I’m so close.

I understand that Bulgarian squats are really good, and lunges are good for vertical, but how often should I be doing these excercises, and how long would it take to increase my vertical by 1 or 2 inches?

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hey mate, this might sound annoying or dumb but having been privately coached, and now doing some coaching my first tip would be work on your form closer to the hoop before you move out that far. You want to build good habits and a good shooting form first. Stand in the hot spot (just to either side of the hoop) and have the ball in your shooting hand. Form an L with your elbow facing the ground. Make sure you are using your fingertips to hold the ball, and it's not resting on your palm. Now, push that elbow up and I'm sure you know how to snap your wrist as a shot. Pretend there's a cookie jar on a shelf and you're trying to put your hand in it. I'd practice WITHOUT a guide hand until you're comfortable with that, don't even jump. Just stand somewhere close to the ring and practice that shot form. Choose a number and aim to make that many in a row, and then that many swishes in a row. You want the ball to get good arc and drop through the ring, not bounce around the sides. Once you've got that form down, put your non-dominent hand on the side of the ball and just use it as a guide. Once you've got that form down start to practice bending your knees. You'll want a foot slightly forward, on your shooting hand side. Just stand, bend your knees, then smoothly stand up and let the rhythm follow through into your shot. It should be one smooth motion of bend, into upright, into shot. Once you nail all of that practice and you're more comfortable with that, then I'd start moving out further. 

Watch some videos on guys like Duncan Robinson and Klay Thompson, they have an excellent stroke. 

Any questions feel free to DM me man, good luck!",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It looks like you are getting good rotation on the ball and have a natural flick of the wrist, so that’s good.

I’d start by your left leg in, instead of kicking it out behind you. Your balance will be off if your shooting off one leg. 

Also I’d just practice keeping a higher release. You release the ball at nipple height when it’ll help your arc to release it a bit higher",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just make an L with your pointer finger and thumb and make sure you aren’t flicking with your left hand too,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shoot up not forwards your form is too easily blocked,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"try practicing getting the motion down so the dip, bringing the ball upwards with your body straight up to release. when i shoot i try to be as compact as possible so make sure on the way up your elbows are pretty close to your body not wide apart.

and i think its been said earlier but have ahigher release point because you are shooting from your chest area it seems. what works for me is when i feel im on my toes just about ima jump, the ball is right above close to my forehead and then i simply jump and release.

try what works out tho and as they have mentioned, practice closer so you develop good shooting habits",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IMHO, I think your form is like this because you dont have enough strength to shoot that far out and it causes you to push the ball forwards instead of upwards.
If I were you I would practice shooting with a normal form closer to rim and gradually increasing the distance.
Hope it helps. 💪💪",,,,,,,

Try to jump forward with both of your legs. Oh and get the ball a little more above before shooting, at where you comfortable at.",,,,,,,

Secondly I'm assuming you mostly do drills and practice shoots in the afternoon (?) What you can do is maybe keep a mattress or a thick blanket directly under the hoop so that noise is minimized. This way you can still practise your shooting without disturbing others.
As for dribbling practise you can't really do much and will probably have to time it in such a manner that you do it during more socially acceptable hours and in the afternoons you can focus on mobility, strength building, speed and your vertical jump.

A couple ways to do that is head to your local basketball court (i would say indoor over outdoor). Watch people play and then ask someone if they have a moment to give you some pointers or to critique your current abilities. 

If you're lucky you'll make a new friend or get some free drills from the experience.

2. One of the most important things in a game that you can do is study a person's shooting range, and how does their shooting change with different distances.
3. If you are defending against them, observe which side to they prefer WHEN you have pushed them to the outside i.e. stay close to them and guard more on the side closer to the basket, depending on whether they go from your better guarded side or from your lesser guarded side shows if they are willing to take risks or how big of a threat are you to them.
4. Every person has THAT one move which they love to use whether it be a dunk or a crossover.
5. Get the person on the edge if you are on offense or defense, their reaction would tell a lot.
6. People have a certain playstyle too, some lack in muscles and use speed while other just try to plow through you.
7. I know this is a different one, but try to steal the ball rather than blocking or stopping them.
8. Also pressurize and harass every person you attack or defend or defend. They get really easy to read when they are irritated.
9. I don't know why but using fakes and judging people's movements and reaction speed etc. might help you.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Watch NBA games and instead of only paying attention to the ball, pay attention to the players without the ball and look at what they do to get open. This will help you get a better understanding of the where your teammates should be standing when you pass to them, how long it takes them to get there, and how long you should keep your dribble alive for.
2. Pay attention to point guards who like to pass. Pay attention to their habits and why they keep doing the things they do. Watch for the type of passes they like to make most, how early or late they pass out of double teams, when they choose to score instead of pass and figure why they did them at those exact moments.
3. Learn about spacing and the types of motion offenses (5  out, 4-1, dribble drive etc). The best way to do this is to play on a team either at school/competitively or through watching basketball and playing 5 vs 5. These are basic sets teams run in 99% of leagues and they all have some similarities so when you learn one you can figure out the rest.
4. Play 5v5 /4 v4 as much as u can.",,,,,,,

Find an spot you like shooting from and just stand there and shoot, you’ll find it becomes easy. Form is super important of course too, look up YouTube videos on how to shoot and that should help.  
For me I found the best thing that improved my jumper was noticing how long pros keep their guide hand on the ball, all the way up until release.  Drills are good and you need them but you can improve without so much formality. 
Kyrie Irving said he didn’t really do drills as a kid, he just tried to pull off moves. 

However if your really set on a drill:
Start standing right in front of the basket, shoot and take a step back every time you don’t *swish* it. If you miss, go back to the start.

I also reccommend this 12 variation mikan drill youtube video for good finishing around the rim. Research the role you want to play and the part they play on the court whether you want to be a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Power Forward Small Forward or Center. Also ik covid is rampant but playing against others like in 5v5 games is important although thats impossible for rn and never be afraid to play with others better than you and learn from them. Also try to emulate a player in the NBA that plays the same position as you and you want to have a similar play style to. Do you like Stephen Curry's off ball hustle and smart off the dribble shooting and catch and shoot style as a PG or Kyrie Irving's crafty and powerful ball on a string tight handles and his insane finishes around the rim as a PG, it's all up to YOU!!! Also watch player breakdowns for their defence and offensive styles, for defence I recommend Scottie Pippen, Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Kawhi Leonard",,,,,,,

The ONLY head count scholarship sports are FBS football, men's and women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, and women's tennis.

I'm voting for hockey as there are so few colleges that offer hockey (there are only like 60 D1 hockey programs in the US vs 350+ D1  basketball programs) and it's not a head count sport, but I'm wondering if that is skewed because there is not a big pool of recruits available.

PS - the intimidation thing can backfire.  Act like you have played against tough competition in the past.  Respect your opponent and have them be the ones doing the talking after the game about you being good, great or neither.  Leave the intimidation stuff alone or get ready for the prelude when you're intimidating some not-so-difficult-to-guard-looking-player and get your lunch delivered to you in front of everyone.  Great players let their play do the talking while respecting the game and other players.  In short, if you're good act like you've been told that in the past.

If you're talking purely in terms of skill I mean he probably was ""better"" than Jordan or at least on par. It was just a different era, Kobe played most of his career with zone defense being allowed and the illegal defense rule being abolished, I'm pretty sure zone defense became legal in the real early parts of the 2000's so Jordan pretty much played in a league where help couldn't come to defend his isolation on the post.

I'm deciding on either 14 or 16 inches big, at first I thought of 14 inches because my backyard doesn't go that far anyway and if it did, I would've picked the 18 inches and start practicing really deep shots, but unfortunately.. nope; and it's so I could take my mid-range game to the next level and start having tighter and more straighter shots so the next time I go outside, my shots are way more consistent.

But then I thought, wait.. if regulations are 18 inches, then wouldn't 14 inches be too small and too difficult then?

But the 16 inches look way too big for me too, it basically just feels like I'm cheating.

I'm not necessarily only going to use this for actual training and to become better but as well as to keep my shots fixed by doing casual shooting, so I don't want to have a hard time getting the ball in.

Generally when using this move you want to make it appear apart of the dribble combination altogether so you no only get more separation from the speed but your immediately putting the defend on your back hip. For the most part advanced players use this move very well for examples look at James Harden in the NBA.,,,,,,,

weaknesses- very very weak shooter, left hand finishing, shot iq, scoring consistency

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" 🤷‍♂️ 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

Most think guards as perimeter players but players like Michael Jordan and Chris Paul thrive off of the mid range, it’s a risky shot but it’s easier for guards rather than forwards and centers, just get better at catching and shooting, shooting while being defended, and shooting off the dribble.
