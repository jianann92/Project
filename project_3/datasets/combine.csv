[HELP] TROUBLE FIXING FORM,,,0,help troubl fix form
,,"Hey mate, this might sound annoying or dumb but having been privately coached, and now doing some coaching my first tip would be work on your form closer to the hoop before you move out that far. You want to build good habits and a good shooting form first. Stand in the hot spot (just to either side of the hoop) and have the ball in your shooting hand. Form an L with your elbow facing the ground. Make sure you are using your fingertips to hold the ball, and it's not resting on your palm. Now, push that elbow up and I'm sure you know how to snap your wrist as a shot. Pretend there's a cookie jar on a shelf and you're trying to put your hand in it. I'd practice WITHOUT a guide hand until you're comfortable with that, don't even jump. Just stand somewhere close to the ring and practice that shot form. Choose a number and aim to make that many in a row, and then that many swishes in a row. You want the ball to get good arc and drop through the ring, not bounce around the sides. Once you've got that form down, put your non-dominent hand on the side of the ball and just use it as a guide. Once you've got that form down start to practice bending your knees. You'll want a foot slightly forward, on your shooting hand side. Just stand, bend your knees, then smoothly stand up and let the rhythm follow through into your shot. It should be one smooth motion of bend, into upright, into shot. Once you nail all of that practice and you're more comfortable with that, then I'd start moving out further. 

Watch some videos on guys like Duncan Robinson and Klay Thompson, they have an excellent stroke. 

Any questions feel free to DM me man, good luck!",0,hey might sound annoy privat coach coach first tip would work form closer hoop move want build good habit good form first stand either side hoop form elbow ground make sure fingertip hold rest palm push elbow sure know snap wrist pretend cooki jar shelf put practic without guid comfort even jump stand somewher close practic form choos number aim make mani row mani swish row want good drop bounc around side form put domin side guid form start practic knee want slightli forward side stand knee smoothli stand rhythm follow smooth motion upright nail practic comfort start move watch video guy like duncan robinson klay thompson excel question feel good

Secondly I'm assuming you mostly do drills and practice shoots in the afternoon (?) What you can do is maybe keep a mattress or a thick blanket directly under the hoop so that noise is minimized. This way you can still practise your shooting without disturbing others.
As for dribbling practise you can't really do much and will probably have to time it in such a manner that you do it during more socially acceptable hours and in the afternoons you can focus on mobility, strength building, speed and your vertical jump.

,,"1. In a game, people have a tendency to do certain things at certain times, I know this does not make sense but let me elaborate.
2. One of the most important things in a game that you can do is study a person's shooting range, and how does their shooting change with different distances.
3. If you are defending against them, observe which side to they prefer WHEN you have pushed them to the outside i.e. stay close to them and guard more on the side closer to the basket, depending on whether they go from your better guarded side or from your lesser guarded side shows if they are willing to take risks or how big of a threat are you to them.
4. Every person has THAT one move which they love to use whether it be a dunk or a crossover.
5. Get the person on the edge if you are on offense or defense, their reaction would tell a lot.
6. People have a certain playstyle too, some lack in muscles and use speed while other just try to plow through you.
7. I know this is a different one, but try to steal the ball rather than blocking or stopping them.
8. Also pressurize and harass every person you attack or defend or defend. They get really easy to read when they are irritated.
9. I don't know why but using fakes and judging people's movements and reaction speed etc. might help you.

,,"1. Watch NBA games and instead of only paying attention to the ball, pay attention to the players without the ball and look at what they do to get open. This will help you get a better understanding of the where your teammates should be standing when you pass to them, how long it takes them to get there, and how long you should keep your dribble alive for.
2. Pay attention to point guards who like to pass. Pay attention to their habits and why they keep doing the things they do. Watch for the type of passes they like to make most, how early or late they pass out of double teams, when they choose to score instead of pass and figure why they did them at those exact moments.
3. Learn about spacing and the types of motion offenses (5  out, 4-1, dribble drive etc). The best way to do this is to play on a team either at school/competitively or through watching basketball and playing 5 vs 5.

is it okay to watch people play basketball?,hi everyone. so i have always liked this game. i used to play in elementary. but i was not very good. and i never pursued it after that. but i still like to shoot hoops. so today i was riding my bike around my neighborhood.. and there is a park with a small court. and as i was riding by. i saw a group of guys playing. i rode by and then on my next pass i decided to sit and watch. at first i was parked in someones driveway. nobody was around and i figured if the owner of the house pulled in or came outside. then i would leave. but they never did. and then i decided to get a closer look and leave the persons driveway. i kept watching until they were done and left. so my question is. was that ok to do? im pretty sure legally it was fine since it was a park. but im wondering if the players thought it was ok. i am shy and not to good at talking to people. so i probably looked weird just sitting on my bike and watching. but it was so fun to watch. so have any of you encountered some watchers at the park? and how do you react or feel about it. i plan on doing it again. maybe i will work up the courage to ask next time.,,0,okay watch peopl basketbal everyon alway like game elementari good never pursu still like hoop today bike around neighborhood park small court saw group guy rode next pass decid watch first park someon driveway nobodi around figur owner pull outsid would leav never decid closer look leav person driveway kept watch done left question pretti sure fine sinc park wonder player thought good talk peopl probabl look weird bike watch watch encount watcher park react feel plan mayb work courag ask next

The only negative part of this has been these blisters that I get on my feet, specifically on my toes, my right toe especially. Is there a way I can prevent this? I did some very quick research last night and a lot of people say that shoes and socks might be the solution. Right now I play/practice on an outdoor court in very thin socks, and adidas nmd's.

How big of a rim should I buy for this quarantine?,"I'm planning on buying a basketball rim to drill it up on the wall of my house,  just for casual shooting and all that in my backyard.. I've read some articles online and they say that regulation rims are 18 inches big, I DON'T want that because it feels way too big, I don't know if it's just me but I could've swore I've been practicing and playing on way smaller rims.

I'm deciding on either 14 or 16 inches big, at first I thought of 14 inches because my backyard doesn't go that far anyway and if it did, I would've picked the 18 inches and start practicing really deep shots, but unfortunately.. nope; and it's so I could take my mid-range game to the next level and start having tighter and more straighter shots so the next time I go outside, my shots are way more consistent.

But then I thought, wait.. if regulations are 18 inches, then wouldn't 14 inches be too small and too difficult then?

But the 16 inches look way too big for me too, it basically just feels like I'm cheating.

I'm not necessarily only going to use this for actual training and to become better but as well as to keep my shots fixed by doing casual shooting, so I don't want to have a hard time getting the ball in. 

So my question comes, Should I buy a 14 inch rim, 16 inch rim, or just stick with the regulation with 18 inch?

Please help with the noise of my basketball practice,"I'm 16 (6ft) and have lost 20kg doing basketball drills and bodyweight plyometics in my back garden. (3 months now)

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

What can I do to reduce the noise?
I was thinking of removing the grass in my backyard and build a basketball court. (As i only have a 2mx10m space to play. 6ft6x10ft)
Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

I've been saving up for a backyard court for 6 months now and in another 6 I'll be able to afford it.

Untill then and after then what can I do to reduce the noise?

So I just started like officially liking basketball :D,"Ok so I know what you're thinking.

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

So after binging secret base videos, doing some research on the organization as well as watching the team get a 2nd victory over the pacers in the playoffs, I became a Miami Heat Fan.

How to increase your vertical (The way I did),"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.

* 1: You can't just do a million calf raises

I watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.

*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire body

The few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.

* 3: Learn the proper form

If you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.

* 4: Start Low with a small ball

Now not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball

* 5: Dunk every day

This tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!

These 5 super simple steps take a lot of hard work, but helped increase my vertical over 8 inches.

Questions on getting signed NBA memorabilia as a gift,"Hi,

I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:

* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? 

Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?

And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? 

* Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?

2. The Cavs have no reason to make that trade, they want to give the lkay tome at guard spots to give to sexton/garland and continue to hope they develop.
KLove isn't a center/TT is a free agent and drummond has a $28mil player option.
3. John collins just signed a max and his game is perfect to pair with trae AND they have capella. You can't play harrell and capella together anyway since they have the same strengths. 
4. You keep lou coming off the bench because his only value is his offense, if you start him, he gets hunted on defense on every possession. 
I agree with not trading PG for russ, that's a terrible trade and putting russ and pat bev is also a terrible idea, they hate each other. PG was a great player last year (as the first option) top 3 MVP and DPOY finish. He's a very good shooter as well in the regular season, remember he played as a SG in indiana before playing SF in OKC anyway so not an issue really??
5. This is really the key and I think all they need to do is run it back again but doc has to change his style of coaching and everyone needs to be given clear roles ans expectations. Kawhis the 1st option and PGs #2. Whenever lou wills on the floor he should be given the green light on offense and they should just let him put up as many shots as he wants. If he makes them then great, that's his job, if not pull him off ths floor and play someone that can actually defend and passes the ball. 

Mainly, the clippers need a real point guard who can control the flow of the game and they only had one on the roster who didn't get much time on the floor at all.

I not american, I've never played basketball and I've never discussed this subject with anyone. Where I grew up, all was about soccer. 
Now, I've been watching a few games of the playoffs and I'm really enjoying it. Like, a LOT. 
Of course, I already know some of the basic rules, but I feel really frustrated because I don't understand most of what's happening during the game. 
My soccer knowledge helps a lot to understand some dynamics but I feel too limited.


Can you recommend a good book/website/youtube channel that'll help me learn the vocabulary, the strategies, etc ? Like a basketball course for newbies :p

,,"I think focusing on individual things is a good move right now. Worrying about ""playing well"" is a lot to think about at once, and it's hard to see improvement on a large scale like that.

What are you struggling with? For example, if you spend time every day working on your mid-range shots, you'll start to see small improvements. Once you're making these in-game, you'll get some of your confidence back and realize you can always keep improving in whatever area you focus on. 

It's also important to remember that during periods you feel like you're playing poorly, you can always hustle. Focus on playing good defense, working hard to get rebounds, setting screens, and communicating with your teammates. Be the guy/girl who sprints and dives for loose balls. Speed and conditioning will always give you an edge, so this could be a good time to get in good shape. Find a track and start doing [intervals](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19524240/run-faster-the-fun-way/) and do bodyweight workouts at home. Work on your vertical so you can jump for boards. This will always help. 

Otherwise, a lot of this sounds like confidence is the issue. Start talking yourself up more. Say things like: ""I put the hours of practice in, and now I'm going to play well."" I think working with a trainer or coach one on one could be helpful.

Tilt your feet slightly away from your dominant side to loosen the tension on your lats.

Shoot with only your dominant hand propelling the ball and a strong flick of the wrist. Your wrist should be bent, with your hand pulled back towards yourself slightly.

Release the ball off of either your index or middle finger, or both. Your ring finger and thumb should not be the primary release finger

You should not feel like you are heaving or throwing it with your body. The wrist needs to be the main force.

Try to get some elevation on your shot. Don't hang in the air too long before releasing it, though. It's okay to release it before you get to the peak of your jump, just don't release it while you're still on the ground

Guaranteed Way To Become Harder To The Court," 

Creating space is a major key to becoming harder to guard on the court. The best players int he world can create space whether it's for a jumpshot, or a layup.

So what's the best way to create space??

Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!

You can do a sidestep, stepback, fadeway, whatever you need to get your shot off. The point remains the same.

Need a Strategy to help beat my Friends in a fullcourt 2v2,"My friends and I are starting to play full-court 2v2s for fun. We lost this one, but I want to win the next one by making a strategy to beat them.

Me - 5'10 - Can heat up and shoot from anywhere, also got a bit of a handle to beat defenders off the dribble with but not that physical.

My teammate - 5'9 - Big but not fast, can get a rebound and put it back up. Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.

Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.

&amp;#x200B;

We lost our first match up today by 3 points. I had some good moments but I didn't play well overall, losing my shooting rhythm after a couple of misses on a bad park rim. Tried to run pick and roll with my teammate, but Opponent #1 gave me trouble and ended up costing us two turnovers near the end of the game. I can get a shot over him in an iso, and I haven't really tried to drive on him since he's pretty athletic. I can't really drive past any of them since big guy cant shoot and the paint is clogged.

What are the attributes and duties of every basketball position?,,,0,attribut duti everi basketbal
,,"It'd take a while to list all of them, and frankly I'm lazy, so I'll just say this. The positions are generally referred to as a number 1-5. The lower the number position a player is the better ball handling, shooting, and passing they have. But they're also smaller. The higher number position someone plays the better they are at posting up, shot blocking, and they're taller. So If you're a 1, you're taking the ball up the floor, you're a play maker, but you're small. If you're a 3, you can do a bit of everything. If you're a 5, you're playing in the post, and you're blocking shots, but you're probably the slowest.

 Here's a little guide to what different positions mean.
Point-playmaker
Guard-good handles
Shooting/stretch-good shooter
Forward-attacks the basket
Center/power-posts up

,,"Point Guard- The best ball handler, playmaker, and generally the leader of the offense. The most important position. Job is to lead the team on both sides of the ball. Like a QB in football

Example: Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Chris Paul...


Shooting Guard- The best shooter/scorer. Job is to be a secondary ball handler, get buckets, and also help out on defense. 

Example: Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade

Small Forward- Most versatile position. The SF should be a balanced between scoring on offense and being a wing or on ball defender.  

Example: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard


Power Forward- a dying position. Back in the 80s-90s this was usually the best post scorer on the team . Now, it more of a mix between small forward, and center position. Shooting and Defense and usually the best attributes of the position.

Examples: Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tim Duncan (classic example) 

Center- the second most important position and most important position on defense. Usually the tallest and strongest, they use height to take away the easiest shot in basketball (paint shots), and modern centers are versatile enough to switch on to smaller and quicker guards. 

On offense, modern centers can stretch the floor by shooting, or have a reliable post game to score buckets. But old centers got down low and scored in the paint 90% of the time.

mm...

I got a few pointers

Faking-Do not overdo and in some scenarios, you don't even have to break down your defender.

Study your opposition before game or if that is not possible then study them while you are in the game. Pivot foot, shooting range, release time, special moves (ankle breakers,jumpers etc.), speed,agility,play style,strength,weakness,how to exploit them anything which gives your advantage.

If you cannot score much on offense, then become a better defense. Stealing a ball and charging front gives a good advantage.

As for dribbling, here are a few moves:-

The Dream Shake is a pretty simple yet effective move.

The normal stepback, but just shake up the defense a little bit before that you know?

Just try few floaters here and there.

Drive front near the basket but then suddenly but not too fast, allow the defender to catch up and then pull back as much as your shooting range allows.

Use both hands, do not depend on one.

Do some crossover, between both hands.

Right-Left-Right-Charge right and get a quick release in. (defender does not catch up)

\-Charge right, defender catches up, stop and pass the ball if no space.

Disguise passes as shots or shots as passes sometimes.

I get into the shooting position and shoot, but to the teammate instead of basket SOMETIMES.

Behind the back, between the legs.

Try altering your release time a bit to catch your defender off guard.

If you are being double-teamed then someone from your team must be free.

If you break through one defender and another reaches in, study the position of teammate before or during the play, pass the ball in any way (chest pass, behind the back, between defenders' legs or anything).Just get the ball inside the basket most efficiently.

Run for the ball when your team has it, run for the ball when your opponent has it. By this, I mean just stay in the same boat as the player with the ball.

When a player screens you, do not bother who did or how it happened. Sidestep and get where you have to be. Be on constant movement, keep your defender on the edge.

If you are playing against any opponent, and they are able to match you, always have that punch to be used in emergencies.

Stay near the ball or its handler but pl do not be a ball hog unless your teammates are bad.

Fadeaways can make good space but also work on behind the back, figure 8 dribbles, bullet passes. Anything which gives you the advantage, just do it (but play clean, unless your opponent is playing dirty then it is your choice just do no kill them.)

EDIT-Look at the opponent also not just the ball. Try to think how to make new plays when at home.

More athletic?,"Hey everyone, 
I'm  5'10-11/ 178-9cm 
15 years old 
And if it matters (hopefully not) Asian

So for the past 4months since April, I haven't got the chance to get back on the court. Hence, I decided to work on my athletism, running faster jumping higher etc.

My standing vert has increased by at least 4-6 inches and is at 27inches now. Same with my running vert at 32 inches. I didn't do any test on my running speed. 

My question is, how much more can I improve? 

Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.
Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.

Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new. 

Also any good cardio exercises that I can do indoors? And what exercise did u do that really pushed ur athletism to the next level?

Thanks!",,0,hey everyon cm year matter hope month sinc april chanc court henc decid work faster jump higher stand increas least inch inch inch speed question much improv alreadi month feel reach peak month scale train bodi weight weight exercis progress increas also plyo appropri realis diet weight hold decid leaner drop kg kg also take recoveri serious stretch foam roll workout need continu grind need someth new also good cardio exercis indoor exercis realli push next level thank
Advice for young players,"Looking back at my basketball career as I'm going to college, the highest level I played was Varsity and even on that team I wasn't very good. So my biggest advice to young players is to play more. It may not be the smartest idea right now during quarantine so make sure you stay safe.

Anyway, at my HS I was very introverted so didn't have a lot of friends that played b-ball but I loved it and practiced a lot by myself. Shooting drills, handling drills, analyzing pro games. I was trying everything to make myself improve BY MYSELF. And that was the greatest problem, there's only so much you can do by yourself.

You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.

The only time I played with others was during team practices and games. The people on my team were constantly playing every weekend with friends.

So this is my greatest advice. Play pickup or something. And most importantly, make sure you have fun. I'm gonna be honest, I hated practicing by myself because it was boring and exhausting and repetitive and frustrating. Not very fun. Playing with friends will be great.",,0,advic young player look basketbal career colleg highest level varsiti even team good biggest advic young player may smartest quarantin make sure stay safe anyway introvert practic drill handl drill analyz game everyth make improv greatest problem much need good skill build new thing see work watch game much need actual put game like situat improv speed team practic game peopl team constantli everi weekend greatest advic pickup someth importantli make sure gonna honest practic bore exhaust repetit frustrat great

,,"Referee here. This is a good opportunity to talk about Legal Guarding Position. If you can obtain and maintain LGP, you can easily avoid being called for a foul. Here are some of the basic things to remember about LGP as it pertains to guarding a dribbler:

1. Every player is entitled to a spot on the playing court provided such player gets there first without illegally contacting an opponent.
2. A player who extends an arm, shoulder, hip, or leg into the path of an opponent is not considered to have LGP if contact occurs.
3. To obtain LGP, the guard must have both feet touching the playing court AND the guard's torso must be facing the opponent.
4. After LGP is obtained, the guard is not required to continue facing the dribbler. The guard is permitted to move backwards, obliquely, or laterally, but NOT forwards towards a dribbler that results in contact.
5. When guarding an opponent with the ball, no time or distance is required to obtain an initial guarding position. A dribbler should expect to be defended head on.

Given this, what matters is did you establish LGP before the contact occurred. If you didn't, and you're riding the dribbler shoulder to shoulder, this would be considered a blocking foul.",0,refere good opportun talk guard obtain maintain lgp easili avoid foul basic thing rememb lgp pertain guard dribbler everi player entitl court provid player first without contact oppon player extend shoulder path oppon consid lgp contact occur obtain lgp guard must feet touch court guard torso must oppon lgp obtain guard requir continu dribbler guard permit move backward obliqu later forward toward dribbler result contact guard oppon distanc requir obtain initi guard dribbler expect defend given matter establish lgp contact occur dribbler shoulder shoulder would consid foul

,,"Set a focus on what you are going to improve. Make a plan for how many shots of various types you will make. For each move/shot you practice, practice a countermove an equal number of makes.

For example, maybe I want to improve my game out of triple threat position. So I will spin it to myself coming up to the wing, as if coming off a pin-down. Each time it will be catch -&gt; reverse pivot toward the middle of the floor.

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low and make a lay-up: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low and shoot a pull-up off one dribble: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; jab, crossover step -&gt; get to rim and finish: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; jab, crossover step -&gt; shoot a pull-up off one dribble: 3 makes

Catch -&gt; reverse pivot -&gt; rip low, jab, shoot a 3: 3 makes

Repeat on the other side of the floor going the other direction.

After doing this a couple sessions, I would add in more complex variations to the progression. Maybe a practicing a shimmy fake, maybe working on mid rips rather than low rips, maybe making my catch another 3 feet further out, or switching to working catch-&gt;reverse pivot-&gt;shot fake. Or outside pivot instead of reverse pivot.

I'm not saying this is the workout to do; this is just about one small aspect of the game. But this is the approach. Decide what you want to improve, specifically. Make a plan for the type of shots you want to shoot, and COUNT YOUR MAKES, not your attempts.

,,"Honestly man just learn at your own pace. I‚Äôm in high school myself but I‚Äôve been playing basketball since I was 4 or 5. Here are my overall tips (Sorry if it‚Äôs a lot). Learn the PROPER way to shoot fundamentally. Before you do anything learn how to shoot a basketball the right way. Shooting is something that if learned the right way early, can have a positive impact on your game. Many College athletes or even NBA level players go through multiple variations of their jumpshots because they never learned how to shoot the right way ( ex: Lonzo, Giannis, Fultz). I would focus on at least 100-500 makes a day using the fundamentals depending on how serious you are. The second thing you should focus on is your left hand, after you get shooting down learn how to shoot with your left hand. Your left hand can be used as a weapon and most people do not how to guard left handed shooters and dribblers. (Ex: James Harden, Zion, RJ Barret). After you learn the fundamentals of shooting learn the FUNDAMENTALS of dribbling. Do not start trying to be Kyrie with behind the backs, crossovers, step backs, learn how to dribble walking, jogging and running down the court and practice your change of speed. (Both left and right hand). After you really get dribbling down that‚Äôs when you can focus on the moves and combos just like in 2k. If you have a 65 Ball handling you cannot speed boost or equip elite dribble moves. Same goes for irl, you cannot do advanced moves with a bad ball handle. After you learn dribbling and shooting and become decent-good the rest comes with playing actual games (defense, rebounding, finishing). My final piece of advice is don‚Äôt let people get in your head and discourage you. On the court, people will always try to find a weakness both mentally and physically; do not let them take advantage of you and destroy your goals. I hope you got something useful out of this! Good luck!

A player is out of bounds when he/she touches the floor, or any object other than a player/person, on or outside a boundary. The ball is out of bounds when it touches or is touched by:

1. A player who is out of bounds.
2. Any other person, the floor, or any object on or outside a boundary.

4. The ceiling, overhead equipment, or supports.

No.

,,"It has a lot to do with the cushioning.

1a. The midsole foam is a buffer that impedes sensory feedback from the ground to your soles. You're literally less in touch with the ground;

1b. The inherent instabilities of standing on an elevated and mushy midsole structure means that instead of using all your muscles to push off, they also have to perform an additional task of adjusting for balance;

2. When exerting downward forces to push off, the cushioning foam absorbs and wastes some of the force, i.e. it cushions;

3. varying on your shoe size &amp; type, your pair is adding 0.5-1.5kg in mass.

4. It's obvious that the fit or cut of a shoe can affect the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of one's foot. Wearing shoes may be negatively affecting your optimal jumping mechanics.

All the above factors when combined can explain why you're experiencing a significant reduction in your vertical. It's worth noting that [NBA players generally appear to prefer less-cushioned &amp; lighter shoes to maximalist &amp; clunkier alternatives](https://i.redd.it/hw5q0bfownl51.png).",0,cushion midsol foam buffer sensori feedback ground sole liter touch ground inher instabl stand elev mushi midsol structur mean instead push also perform addit task adjust balanc exert downward forc push cushion foam absorb forc cushion vari shoe size type pair kg mass obviou shoe affect dorsiflexion plantar flexion shoe may affect optim jump mechan factor combin explain experienc signific reduct vertic worth note nba player gener appear prefer cushion lighter shoe maximalist clunkier altern http redd hw bfownl png

How do I fix my release," So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it. 
 So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand. 

 I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:

1. I'm too weak

2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball

3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens

4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or hand

There's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.
I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release.

Unpopular Opinion (?): Flopping and arguing with the refs are destroying basketball,"I don't know how you all feel, but in this playoff bubble the amount of arguing, whining, complaining, and flopping in basketball has just gotten out of control. It's been worse and worse each of the past 5-6 years but the lack of fans really highlights the ""extracurriculars"" going on. The refs get bombarded from a star player, go to the screen, rewatch the play, things change, get uncertain, the rhythm changes and the game is less about good plays and more about getting the refs on your side. 

It's really making it hard for me to watch. The refs made some controversial and downright wrong foul calls late in the games today (bucks/heat game 2 and game 7 rockets/thunder) , but I think it's largely from an endless barrage of criticism from players and coaches that they receive that makes their job even harder. Every year flopping is a bigger and bigger part of the game, and soon we'll be watching soccer on a court.

,,"Referee here. Technically, NBA referees can administer technical fouls for flopping if caught in-game, but I don't see it often called. The NBA can and does administer fines for flopping.

The NCAA, in just one year of issuing new flop rules, has handled it better in-game. They issue a warning similar to delay of game if they judge an action to be flopping. The second offense by anyone on the same team is a class B technical foul. I saw this process called multiple times this year.

As for arguing, it wasn't that long ago that the NBA had a zero tolerance policy on any negative reactions towards referees. It was an automatic technical foul. And it SUCKED to watch. It should be up to the referees to manage the game and set the tone over what they will tolerate. ""I understand where you're coming from, here's how I saw it."" ""Coach, we can answer your questions, but I can't address commentary on every play. We have to move on.""

,,"I have a pretty killer stepback and am pretty good at changing directions to get to the rack (can't dunk either, but am tall and can grab rim). My advice would be a warmup drill i do which involves doing a stepback and landing on one foot. Really any single leg hopping is great for basketball, focusing on landing with good mechanics (stick landing, keep knee from caving in a valgus direction, absorb shock to land softly with your glutes and quads). The diagonal stepback move (with or without ball, I do it with a ball when warming up) landing on one leg is a particularly good one to train the deceleration during a stepback 3 where you need to gather your balance quickly and be able to rise up for the shot in rhythm.

A good dribble drive move you can practice to work on functional acceleration is a pullback and go. Basically if driving to the right from near the perimeter, do a hard pullback crossover R to L (either low and tight in front, under right leg, or behind the back if your handles are elite) as if going left or stepping back, then cross L to R and drive hard to the right right past them. Once you have them to the side of you, either go into their body to finish hard off the backboard on the right, do an underhanded reverse finish on left, or kick out to corner if you need to. You can add something else quickly during the pullback to freeze them like a head fake (if executed properly at full speed, your center of mass naturally rising during the hard pullback will trick them enough so you can get a partial blow-by without needing anything else),. Just be careful not to expose the ball too much (particularly during the second cross) so you don't turn it over.

"Question: how to defend 1-on-1 post moves, specifically hook shot and fadeaway","The other day I was playing 1-on-1 with a friend who is of similar height, strength and speed.  Given that there's no shot clock, whichever one of us is on offense has been consistently able to get to the post via driving, then backing down the defender.  Once the offense is close enough (around the second hash mark in the paint), he initiates a series of back-to-the-basket post moves that usually ends in a hook shot or fadeaway jumper.

On defense, neither of us have been able to block or affect the shot of the fadeaway / hook shot, so the point pretty much comes down to whether the shooter misses or not.

Ideally as the defender, I would like to prevent the offense from getting so close to the basket, but it's very difficult because the offense can always make progress and back his way closer to the basket, but as the defender I can't really legally push him away from the basket.  Also, if I really try to apply a strong force, I risk the offense using my momentum against me to do a baseline spin for the easy layup.

Anyone have any ideas how to check the fadeaway / hook shots? Or is this why professional NBA players have dribble limits when they play 1:1, because otherwise it would be too easy for the offense?",,0,question defend post move specif fadeaway day similar height strength speed given clock whichev offens consist post via defend offens close enough around second mark paint initi seri basket post move usual fadeaway jumper defens neither affect fadeaway point pretti much come whether shooter miss ideal defend would like prevent offens close basket difficult offens alway make progress closer basket defend realli push away basket also realli appli strong forc risk offens momentum baselin spin easi layup anyon check fadeaway profession nba player dribbl limit otherwis would easi offens

How to translate my skills into real games,"All those hours of grinding...I am still not seeing the result in real games!

Last month I attended a couple of basketball tournament, and I've found that I can't translate my skills in real games when playing against defenders on me. I am a guard and a very good ball handler that can pull up mid-range shots pretty well, but during the games I was frozen and my head went blank all the times against tough defenders and had to pass the ball to my teammate that can attack the rim.

This sucks.

I practice alone a lot on daily basis after work, and I don't screw around just shoot for fun. I've been grinding my ass off. However, I rarely play real games with others.

If someone's a great shooter, but isn't particularly fast, they'll be gaurded very close (think james harden). If someone's fast, or a powerful driver, but can't shoot, the defender is willing to give them more space (think giannis). Basketball is also a team sport, so when defending you also have to think about things like denying passes, and playing help defence. A lot of NBA teams will also make it part of their offence to switch a bad defender onto a great scorer. So if you're playing someone 1 on 1, and you know how they play, it's usually not too hard to atleast contest their shots.

Books on Basketball essentials - with images,"Hi,

I got into basketball recently and I'd love to get a book with plenty of images (preferably photos but illustrations are cool too).

I am not interested on the history of the sport or biographies of players. I am looking for a book that shows the essential moves, gives advices on exercises to improve, etc. 

I would particularly love player movements broken down in sequential images.

I searched on the internet and found something that is close, it is titled basketball anatomy, the illustrations shows key muscle groups and stuff, but it is more focused on strength training for basketball players. So it looks not bad, bad too niche.

I wonder if basketball for dummies would fit my expectations.

So you can pick up your dribble later than you normally would, and your first step turns into your zero step. In your case, if you use your step then pump fake, you need to make sure your foot doesn't slide after you plant it, and when you jump, you need to jump either off your pivot foot, or both feet.

Another way he makes his dunks look good is that he uses his head and arms to accentuate his dunk. After the ball goes in his arms and head flail around as if there is recoil to his dunks. This makes his dunks seem more powerful as if they were an explosion. So in conclusion just move your legs around while in the air and sell the dunk with your body by moving it even after it is finished.

1. Do a post grad year at a prep school with a reputable basketball program. They may be more well known by college recruiters than your high school, so they may give you more clout. You also won't use any of your college eligibility so you can still play four years in college.
2. Go to a Junior College. JUCOs are probably even more visible than prep schools and probably more talented, too. You will use a year or two of your four year college eligibility, but as long as you are a good student, you will earn college credit and will earn a bachelor's degree at a younger age than if you go to prep school.
3. Take one of your D2 offers and ball. You might find you like the school and wish to stay. Or you could enter the transfer portal and see what D1 attention comes your way. The kid who led all D2 freshmen in scoring last year did this and got like 10 D1 offers immediately. The downside is you will use one of your eligibility years while at the D2 and you will have to sit out from games for one year while at the D1 school (you don't use any eligibility during your sit-out year).

At least in terms of training to be physically better at basketball, weighted leg training (squats, calf raises, straight leg deadlifts and hip thrusts for example) plus plyometrics (box jumps, squat jumps, split jumps, depth jumps, any sort of jumping) will help you increase your vertical and explosiveness which is always going to be extremely beneficial for playing basketball. Sprints are also very handy in increasing one's explosiveness and translate well to the basketball court as you'll be sprinting up and down the court during games.

Also watch a bunch of tutorial videos online explaining the proper shooting mechanics. If you haven't played basketball before you're very likely going to have a broken jumpshot that could use some smoothing out in certain areas. Something I've done for myself a couple times is record my self shooting and analyse where it could be fixed.

I walk into the court full of lights,

The fans on their feet all buzzing with joy,

My family waving with smiles,

I'm glad they've seen who I've become.

The ball is passed to me &amp; i dribble onward,

A screen to the left &amp; I shoot,

A 3 pointer &amp; i'm now in the zone,

We jostle back &amp; forth with many points scored,

A bit of fouls &amp; timeouts used,

The game moves on.

I look around &amp; see my teammates  I've played with,

I'm glad they accepted me &amp; encouraged me to be better,

With endless days of sweating &amp; training,

we are proud of we've become &amp; now bonded by ball,

with trust &amp; love, we move on as family &amp; as one we ball.

Dunks &amp; shots fill the court,

layups &amp; 3's scores the point,

a pass to my mate &amp; the clock tic tocks,

with head up high the court is scanned,

I'm free, he passes &amp; this is it,

scared of ending the game is who i am,

With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,

 A 3 point shot &amp; the game we win.

With smile &amp; joy we celebrate our win,

Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.

I open my eyes with a smile &amp; realize it's all dream,

Stopping the sound of the ball?,"I always played a bit of basketball when I was younger (for school teams and just general messing around). However I only recently got my own net for my back garden. 

Before I got it I decided that I would not bounce the ball in my back garden and would just focus on shooting, as I know the noise can be quite irritating. I have stayed true to this but every time I take a shot the bounce still sounds quite loud. I tried rebounding all my shots before the bounce but that obviously didn't work very well.

There is also sometimes the problem of a stray bounce off the rim that goes towards my window. 

I was looking at returners but it seems the only affordable ones are the ones that collect made shots only. I was wondering if anyone knew of any affordable ones that collected missed shots? Would also be open to other suggestions to solve the noise problem.

Creating for myself and attacking the basket,"I only play pickup really but I need the basics of this shit broken down for me. I‚Äôm pretty embarrassed to be in my 20s and asking this but fuck it.

My main skill is shooting and I feel super confident about it but everyone knows or can tell once they start playing with me. I can typically extend my range a few steps behind the 3 point line too but if a guy just stands in front of me and I have the ball I freeze. I can do just about everything else fine on the court but this, especially when my shots not dropping and my confidence is low I‚Äôll literally just force a shot over my defender or pass it back. I have been practicing a strong dribble and pull-up but need much better ball handling in order to even take 2 strong dribbles. I‚Äôm above average height and feel like with my shooting the defender has to step way up and take my pump fakes seriously but I‚Äôm so far behind in my dribbling and driving that I feel like a fool sometimes. I‚Äôm also not that fast with the ball which hurts my confidence, but even my friends who aren‚Äôt that fast can get it done too so I know it‚Äôs not that big of a deal

So basically, what skills and mental things can I do to build confidence on my drives? Break this down how you do to kids and I‚Äôm willing to learn from the bottom up.

,,"A simple effective move I go to nearly everytime when being closely guarded in pickup or 1v1 is a jab step. Sometimes I'll jab step right and then explode left to drive to the basket. I'm decently athletic so that does help my explosion, but if your defender is playing real close to you because of your shooting ability, then you should have an easier time being able to get past them when they're not expecting a drive.

However you obviously can't get away with the exact same move everytime so I do mix it up. I might jab step right, hesitate like I'm about to dribble left, but then explode right. Another variation is jab stepping right, one dribble left, and then step back for the shot as I'll usually have enough space at that point. That combination is very effective as it means you're stepping back into a rhythm shot if you're right-handed. If you're a lefty then you can do the same combination of moves but the sides reversed.

Another jab step variation I use (and forgive me if my explanation isn't very clear), is  to basically turn around on my left pivot foot, with my back facing the defender, before either jab stepping with my right foot to my left side and then exploding right, or just simply exploding to the ring on my left side. I saw Fred van vleet do that move in a pickup game on you tube and it looked simple enough so I decided to add it to my repertoire. 

Honestly I'd recommend just watching NBA players play 1 on 1 pickup games, as you get a chance to really watch their footwork and how they create space. hopefully my explanations made sense for ya.",0,simpl effect move nearli everytim close guard pickup jab step sometim jab step explod left basket decent help defend real close abil easier expect howev obvious away exact move everytim mix might jab step hesit like dribbl left explod anoth variat jab step dribbl left step usual enough space point combin effect mean step rhythm lefti combin move side revers anoth jab step variat forgiv explan clear basic around left pivot defend either jab step left side explod simpli explod left side saw fred vleet move pickup game tube look simpl enough decid repertoir honestli recommend watch nba player pickup game chanc realli watch footwork creat space hope explan made sens

,,"I know this is going to run counter to the narrative but over my 30 or so years of playing I‚Äôve spent most of my time on a legitimate 10 foot rim. *However*, playing on rims a little lower than 10 feet and a little bit higher than 10 feet was just a fact of life for me. It generally wasn‚Äôt much of an issue and I succeeded as a shooter for years at my particular level. 

If you‚Äôve got a choice between 10 foot rim and one higher than 10, I‚Äôd pick the 10 foot rim every time.

Why do lots of NBA players jump before shooting?,"My best guess is that by jumping before shooting they can focus more on the horizontal distance the ball travels rather than how high it goes, but surely it's more beneficial to combine arms with legs? 

There are many players who do this, so it would make more sense to give examples of those who don't, like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard.

As for me, I prefer to shoot while jumping as opposed to after jumping, as I always seem to undershoot when I  do the latter. I feel like shooting midair just introduces another variable to keep track of, and I often lose balance (or maybe I'm just not athletic enough to pull shots like that off). Maybe height matters?

,,"Just thinking off the top of my head for my 2¬¢ worth.  Catching and shooting in one motion is one of the most delicate things in basketball.  Delicate because you normally have to catch the ball softly.  You need a near perfect pass and you need space to get the shot off (not a ton of space but more than normal).  Catching the ball softly, as opposed to catching with authority, means you need the space or otherwise the defense can knock the ball out of your hands easier.  This problem is multiplied because most catch and shoots are less lift off the floor.  Catch and shoots also require near perfect timing.  Also lots of players prefer the timing mechanisms of stepping into their shot.

In all, if you catch and attempt to shoot in one motion with the defender closer than required - you have a soft catch and come off the floor less, so the defender has an easier time and can get a shooter stuck in the air with the only remaining option to pass and the shooter has less time so fewer options to recover.",0,think top worth catch motion delic thing basketbal delic normal catch softli need near perfect pass need space space normal catch softli oppos catch author mean need space otherwis defens easier problem multipli catch lift floor catch also requir near perfect also player prefer mechan step catch attempt motion defend closer requir soft catch come floor defend easier shooter stuck option pass shooter fewer option recov

,,"It could be a myriad of reasons but the biggest that I can think of is that jumping high and dunking are NOT the same thing. Similar, but not identical. Dunking is a very specific skill that requires coordination, ball control, body control, explosiveness, timing, and positioning ON TOP OF jumping high enough to actually do it. Dunking is a skill, and like all skills, must be trained. Here's what I would do. Firstly find a ten foot hoop:

Run and jump and see if you can grab rim. Can you do it with both hands? This may sound silly to you but practicing your form and run up help immensely and assure you're not overestimating your abilities.

Then I would try this dunk progression provided you can grab rim, two hands, 9 out of 10 times: golf ball, tennis ball, mini basketball (like for indoor hoops above doors), volleyball, soccer ball, women's basketball, deflated basketball, regulation ball. If you're not dunking yet, you will get stuck on one of these before you hit regulation. Which ever one you're stuck on, keep practicing it until you can do it 9/10 times. The reason? You're not training to jump high. You're training to dunk. No one jumps their highest WITH the ball, but you can train to make this difference as small as possible. 

Simply put, you simply have the athleticism if your post is accurate about your vertical but lack the skill. Luckily for you, it is MUCH easier to train the skill than train the athleticism and requires a lot less time. Good luck bro.

,,"I mean anyone about 6 foot won‚Äôt always be able to dunk, dunking requires practice and training no matter what height you are (unless you‚Äôre like 7 foot). 

The reason you mentioned can be explained by three things. 

Firstly, when going for a dunk off the dribble, you use less arm swing, and that will reduce your vertical if you don‚Äôt know how to swing up with the back.

Secondly, you have adrenaline when in game. Going for a rebound or put back dunk in game will always be easier as your CNS is firing quicker and you have that desire to get up. You‚Äôll be running quicker, jumping quicker e.t.c. Which leads quite nicely to...

The third reason. You might not be jumping high enough. People on the ground will obviously think you jump higher than you actually do because of the angle. Maybe they think you‚Äôre getting a whole hand above the rim but in actuality it‚Äôs only half that. 



Now, how to fix this? Allocate time for ‚Äúdunk/vertical‚Äù sessions. Get to the court, warm up PROPERLY, play a game of pickup/one on one and go hard. When that adrenaline is flowing you can feel it, you want to expend that energy. Now stop playing and go for a jump without the ball. Only think about one key element of the jump, forget all else. For me it‚Äôs focusing on the last two steps. Really go for it, try and touch as high as possible on the rim. If possible get someone to record you doing it.

"As a Basketball Fan, This Sucks","Wanted to share a short piece I wrote.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. For myself, and so many others, watching NBA basketball has always been a way to escape. A way to escape the adversity and hardships in our daily life, and the inherent pain and suffering that we all experience as human beings. The NBA allowed me to dream like a kid again, to dream of my childhood team winning a championship, to dream that I could soar like Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But, my favorite thing about the NBA and sports, is the way that it brings people together. People from all walks of life, united, regardless of color or religion, rooting for one purpose. The chance to win.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. In times like these, with the kind of year that *we all* have had, we needed sports. We needed an escape, now, more than ever. We desperately needed a reminder, of what it was like to hope, to believe, and to dream again. I wish that the NBA would continue on so that I could continue to escape reality and continue living in the comfort of my own bubble. But, that would be taking the easy way out. The reality is, we would never grow, evolve, or improve if we never left our comfort zones and turned a blind eye to issues that made us feel sad or uncomfortable.

So yes, as a basketball fan, this sucks. But this is bigger than basketball. Our country needs change, now, more than ever. And we are so fortunate to have such a powerful organization in the NBA, to have the courage to take a stand, trailblaze a path for us all to follow, and inspire us to do everything within our power to incite the change we need.",,0,basketbal want share piec wrote basketbal mani watch nba basketbal alway escap escap advers hardship daili inher pain suffer experi human nba dream like dream childhood team championship dream could soar like michael jordan lebron jame favorit thing nba sport bring peopl togeth peopl walk unit regardless religion root purpos chanc basketbal like kind year need sport need escap ever desper need remind like hope believ dream nba would continu could continu escap realiti continu comfort would take easi realiti would never grow evolv improv never left comfort zone issu made feel uncomfort basketbal basketbal countri need chang ever fortun power organ nba courag take stand trailblaz path follow inspir everyth within power incit chang need

,,"How did you manage to get comfortable with running the court before learning basic dribbles?  In my head, PF's are usually in the key, anticipating passes or securing rebounds, or providing screens, opening paths for the scorers; Basically, off-ball players. When a PF gets the ball, he should already be in a position to either take the shot or dish it out, not move with the ball.   


Of course, this does not apply in all scenarios, but, in my experience as a PF, the only time I ever ran the ball was to drive or pass, and usually never more than 13ft since big men usually need to get to the other side and set up the pattern first. There are also scenarios where you might be forced to bring the ball since both guards are locked up, but, in my opinion, these scenarios are few and far between and are not worth counting on.   


On the other hand, learning how to dribble will help you move more fluidly and give you more space to do your job.   


As you mentioned, you've only been playing basketball for 2 years, it's still too early for you to think about being satisfied.

&gt;3. I have very bad social skills so I couldn‚Äôt make any friends while playing basketball.

2 is the shooting guard, as the name suggests, they're usually the best shooter. They can put the ball on the floor if they need, but usually play more catch and shoot.

3 is the small forward. They're usually the all around player who can do a bit of everything. Most of their points will come from driving to the basket.

4 is the power forward. They can post up if they need to, but will primarily score from driving still.

5 is the center. They will usually play with their back to the basket, and post up their defender. They'll often also get most of their team's rebounds, and are in charge of cleaning up any shots their teammates miss.

Usually if you're smaller and quicker, you'll play a 1or 2. If you're taller, but maybe pretty lanky, you'll play a 3 or 4. If you're the tallest, and strongest, you'll play a 5.

How do you become a better scorer (not just shooter)?,"I just play casually.

I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.

I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!

Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.

It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.

Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.

I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.

TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But in 5v5 my player defends the shot super close, and if I drive a help defender comes in and the paint is clogged. And there never seems to be enough space to work my defender off the dribble. I don't have any scoring moves or dribble moves, I just do basic stuff so maybe i need to improve that.",,0,becom better scorer shooter casual figur rebound defens basic offens good scorer score well come terribl probabl space work defend score even defend help defens know teammat open defend close space help defend much dribbl dribbl around defend anoth defend reach half court offens score catch finish offens rebound put also forc insid miss rebound put tip feel like need realli good dribbl move work specif score move reli half court offens like step jumper fadeaway especi dribbl like danni green offens creat make score put score space creat myshot player defend super close help defend come paint never seem enough space work defend dribbl score move dribbl move basic mayb need improv
,,"Umm...

I got a few pointers

Faking-Do not overdo and in some scenarios, you don't even have to break down your defender.

Study your opposition before game or if that is not possible then study them while you are in the game. Pivot foot, shooting range, release time, special moves (ankle breakers,jumpers etc.), speed,agility,play style,strength,weakness,how to exploit them anything which gives your advantage.

If you cannot score much on offense, then become a better defense. Stealing a ball and charging front gives a good advantage.

As for dribbling, here are a few moves:-

The Dream Shake is a pretty simple yet effective move.

The normal stepback, but just shake up the defense a little bit before that you know?

Just try few floaters here and there.

Drive front near the basket but then suddenly but not too fast, allow the defender to catch up and then pull back as much as your shooting range allows.

Use both hands, do not depend on one.

Do some crossover, between both hands.

Right-Left-Right-Charge right and get a quick release in. (defender does not catch up)

\-Charge right, defender catches up, stop and pass the ball if no space.

Disguise passes as shots or shots as passes sometimes.

I get into the shooting position and shoot, but to the teammate instead of basket SOMETIMES.

Behind the back, between the legs.

Try altering your release time a bit to catch your defender off guard.

If you are being double-teamed then someone from your team must be free.

If you break through one defender and another reaches in, study the position of teammate before or during the play, pass the ball in any way (chest pass, behind the back, between defenders' legs or anything).Just get the ball inside the basket most efficiently.

Run for the ball when your team has it, run for the ball when your opponent has it. By this, I mean just stay in the same boat as the player with the ball.

When a player screens you, do not bother who did or how it happened. Sidestep and get where you have to be. Be on constant movement, keep your defender on the edge.

If you are playing against any opponent, and they are able to match you, always have that punch to be used in emergencies.

Stay near the ball or its handler but pl do not be a ball hog unless your teammates are bad.

Fadeaways can make good space but also work on behind the back, figure 8 dribbles, bullet passes. Anything which gives you the advantage, just do it (but play clean, unless your opponent is playing dirty then it is your choice just do no kill them.)

EDIT-Look at the opponent also not just the ball. Try to think how to make new plays when at home.",0,pointer fake overdo scenario even defend studi opposit game possibl studi game pivot releas special move ankl jumper speed agil strength weak exploit anyth advantag cannot score much offens becom better defens steal charg front good advantag dribbl move dream shake pretti simpl yet effect move normal stepback shake defens littl know floater front near basket suddenli defend catch pull much depend crossov left charg releas defend catch charg defend catch stop pass space disguis pass pass sometim teammat instead basket sometim behind alter releas catch defend guard doubl team someon team must defend anoth reach studi teammat pass chest pass behind defend anyth insid basket effici team oppon mean stay boat player player screen bother sidestep constant movement keep defend oppon match alway punch emerg stay near handler hog unless teammat fadeaway make good space also work behind figur dribbl bullet pass anyth advantag clean unless oppon dirti choic edit look oppon also think make new home

,,"Hey guys, looking for advice on a new ball shoe. I've been wearing a pair of PG2's for the last year and they're worn out now, mostly because I've been using them outdoors recently due to the pandemic. I really like how this shoe hugs my foot and holds it in place, ankle support is great, but what I do find lacking is any kind of bounce. Also, the shoe feels like it has no flex so it is hard for me to push off with my forefoot on jumpshots.

I'm the biggest guy in my play group at 6'2 so I usually fulfill the role of the center - rebounds, rim protection, post-ups, etc. I also take a lot of jump shots on offense. Basically what I'm saying is I get vertical a lot, so I need a shoe that helps me with this. I need some bounce, cushioning, and impact protection. I also play out on the perimeter a fair bit because I'm a good shooter and I like to drive.

I feel like despite being the big in my group, my playstyle is much more like a wing/forward who can play out on the perimeter or down in the post depending on my match-up. So I'm looking for a shoe that can handle both.

From watching and reading reviews, the shoes I'm considering right now are the Air Jordan XXXIV, Nike KD 12 or 13, Jordan Why Not? Zer0.3, NB Omn1s, Kyrie 6, Harden Vol 4, and Dame 5 (largely because it is supposed to be good for outdoor play). I will likely end up picking up 2 new pairs, one for outdoors and one for indoors for when gyms open up again.

I have not owned a lot of ball shoes in the past so any help narrowing down this list is much appreciated. I'm getting more into this and I'm enjoying learning about ball shoes more. If you have questions about my playstyle/preferences let me know. Also, if you have a recommendation that isn't on this list feel free to mention it!

What is the difference between NBA and StreetBall?,"When I search on Internet for differences Streetball and NBA, I get that streetball is-

1. Rougher than NBA
2. Some fouls are ignored (i.e. dribble with a knee tap, or for example Professor Live's Crazy Legs)
3. Not much structure between players, no-one has a job of being a Center, Power Forward etc.
4. Has greatest differences in intensity in different parts of games
5. Unorthodox rules (ex. Winner's ball etc

But my main question is how do you define a ""Streetball movement""vs""NBA movement"" (like, why Professor Live's moves are not applicable in NBA) or (sometimes when a player in NBA dunks or does a crossover in a certain way, suddenly he becomes a StreetBaller)?",,0,differ nba streetbal search internet differ streetbal nba streetbal rougher nba foul ignor dribbl knee tap exampl professor crazi much structur player center power forward greatest differ intens differ part game unorthodox rule winner question defin streetbal movement vs nba movement like professor move applic nba sometim player nba dunk crossov certain suddenli becom streetbal
,,"I guess it comes down to the eye test. When you watch the NBA you see coordination, sophistication and a certain ‚Äòstandard‚Äô to how players play. Streetball on the other hand, is wilder, more for entertainment purposes rather than winning. 

One great example would probably be Jamal Crawford. His dribbling is so unorthodox when seen in the NBA but it would be pretty common in Streetball.

,,"In SB, you are a lot less restricted in terms of creativity and style, as seen with the dribbling tricks you mentioned and often the lack of a shot clock. It's more like 5 1 on 1 matchups than the NBA's 1 5 on 5 matchup system.

In the NBA, though, players have to bend rules and play with the defense (which is not played with the same attention to detail in SB, but admittedly has become soft in the league and more about cerebral defense than physicality) in order to achieve the most efficient shot on as near as makes no difference 100 possessions per game. Stats are also tracked more accurately so the personal element of the game means more to some players, see James Harden always averaging more than 30 and many other stat padders over the years. And lastly, the preparation and studying that players go through before games means that they are so much more precise with literally every thought and movement. Bouncing the ball of someone's head and stepping back over them, for example, works in SB often as long as you put the defender to sleep with a lot of fast dribbles. In the NBA, try that and not only will the defensive player try to steal the ball during your move, they'll likely foul you hard so as not to look like a fool in front of the millions of viewers.

Lastly, with only 24 seconds on the clock, if your complex streetball iso move does not lose the defender and clear you for an open shot, there is so little time to create a good shot on a set 5 man defense that, while you were doing all those crazy dribbles, keyed in on the potential passing and driving lanes, closing off your options entirely. We see players use certain SB derived moves in the league all the time though, and those movements have led players to great heights!

I'm 6'3 and just really started really focusing on my vertical and improving my athleticism this past year. For me, I'd say two hands is just a mental barrier. I prefer dunking with 2 hands over 1 everytime especially when I am going off 2 feet. I attached an article that breaks down jumping off 2, as well as the video from it that I thought does a good job as well. I would say work on your 2 foot technique and you will see improvements pretty quickly. Make sure you're not losing any power, energy and speed through your strides and jump. Best way is to record yourself and try to break it down as best you can!

Waist pain,"Hello everyone 

It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. 

To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  
I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that? 

Any help or oppinion is greatly appreciated.

If opposing players are out there talking trash to you or whoever else comes around, try not to take it personally. 

If your own teammates are getting pissed at you because of mistakes you're making, try to reflect and think about whether their criticism is justified (even if it's poorly presented). Maybe use that as motivation to continue improving. 

If games as a whole tend to devolve into a dumpster fire where everyone's arguing about foul calls every other play, then you might just need to find a new place to play.

Question about defending a dunk,I was playing basketball with a few buddies. We were playing 2 vs 1. Me and my friend were attacking. He passed the ball to me and I jumped to dunk the ball. The defender instead of blocking my dunk pushed my lower body while I was in the peak of my jump. I lost my control in the air and fell painfully on my back on hard concrete. This is an illegal move right?

Look up what legal guarding position is and what a defender is permitted to do once they have established LGP.

,,"That, my friend, is called bush league.",0,bush leagu
,,"Probably a flagrant foul, to be honest. That ""defense"" injures people and starts fights.

The defender is entitled to the space he is on, and to jump straight up and down. He can jump, and put his hands straight up into the air to bother the attacker. Even if there is contact, it is not a foul.

Of course if the defender is able to jump, and, without hitting the defender, get his hand on the ball or slap it away, it's a legal block.

Typically, if the first contact is defender's hand to ball, refs won't call a foul on any subsequent body contact, though your mileage may vary.

If the dunker is much larger than the defender, the defender can attempt to take a charge. If he is planted ""legal guarding position"" by the time the attacker leaves the floor, and the attacker just runs him over, it's an offensive foul.

In outdoor pick-up basketball especially, we generally had some unwritten rules when it came to defending dunks. 

* Never push a dunker when he's airborne

* Don't undercut a dunker (charges generally aren't a thing in pick-up so there's little point to sliding underneath an airborne player). 

* Be weary of tracking down a dunker in a high-speed, chasedown scenario when there's a metal basketball pole in the vicinity (as is the case on most outdoor courts). 

In indoor, organized leagues where something was on the line, I was a lot more understanding of everything defenses would do to stop me from dunking (except for the pushing).

Youth Coaches: Stop Playing Only Zone Defense,"This is a message to youth coaches that want to try and help your kids grow as players. I coach Freshmen basketball, and one of the biggest hurdles I face each year is teaching kids how to play man-to-man defense. 

Within recent years, I‚Äôve noticed that the majority of youth coaches exclusively teach zone defense, and kids usually aren‚Äôt taught the basics of man-to-man defense. Even my best players that travel all over and play AAU ball have no idea what a weak-side rotation looks like or how to guard a pick-n-roll outside of a switch.

I hear kids say things like ‚Äúyour man put up 20 points on you‚Äù without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they‚Äôre only responsibility is the player they‚Äôre assigned to.

Please teach your kids how to play man-to-man, even if it means losing a game or two or getting some push back from kids/parents that don‚Äôt know any better.

Officiating on post-ups is very inconsistent across levels. If his back is to you, you can use an arm bar across his low back/on his hip. Generally, the defender can stand their ground.

Then again, depending on your age, you really might just need to trust your own development. Maybe you haven't put in the extensive training to really pay off just yet.

,,"Pass first PG, your job will get easier if you can make open 3s. Space the floor for your scorers to go to work.

I'll tell you how I'd work on this with guys. Take it or leave it.

You say your midrange game is good, thats a good place to start. Warmup, then just start knocking down spot shots from within your comfort zone. Maybe 20 or 30 makes. Now take 1 big step back and shoot from there. One spot at a time, don't move around. If you miss three in a row, step back into your midrange comfort zone and shoot until you make 3 in a row. Then the big step back out.

Make 5 in a row from a spot, then head to a different spot.

After 2-3 sessions, you will find the ""one step back"" area now feels in your comfort zone. Now you can start going 2 big steps back. Then 3.

Don't stop when you are making 3s with your toes on the line. Need to be able to drill them from your spacing spots. Develop range from 3 or 4 feet back from the line.

Don't worry about off-the-dribble, catching on the move, or off an attacking move right now. First you must develop basic catch and shoot to a high level of accuracy.

Focus on shooting above the break for PG, unless your team's office has the PG clear to corner after making an entry pass. In that case focus on corners.

Is your team's facility open for use? Do they have a rebounding machine? Very useful for this type of practice. Ask your coach.

I think you can get from midrange to 3pt range in 8-10 sessions of focused, intentional practice barring any major mechanical issues.

"You are not a NBA player, stop shooting threes unless you are extremely efficient","I quit basketball 10 years ago due to various reasons. I starting playing again March and joined a recreational league last week. I am a pretty decent center 6'7 and my post moves are still pretty solid. However I cant dribble a ball to save my life. So I dont dribble, I pass, post moves get to the rim etc. I played in a recreational league before and I dont think I have ever shot a three in a serious match(I am a center but still)

But for the love of god and this annoys me so much: why does everyone think shooting threes is efficient. I havent seen anyone who averages above 25% in shooting drills so why the fuck do you think it is a good idea to shoot threes. They are the most wasteful shot in basketball unless you are an elite level player.

&gt;Sorry but this is a serious competion it is in the European system but it isn't just for fun, everyone is trying their hardest to win

I mean this politely, but if the league is that serious I would have assumed it'd have at least a couple guys who could make more than 25 percent of their 3-pointers in shooting drills. 

Our amateur line is generally shorter in America (6.02 m) but even extending out to 6.7 m it seems like I know a fair amount of fellow players (myself included) who can certainly connect on more than 25 percent during shooting drills (at 6.02, we're often comfortably above 60-65 percent... which is still far from elite but solid enough).

Point being, if you're playing among guys who can knock down that shot at a better-than-abysmal rate then there's lots of benefits. It's a weapon and players out our way grow up knowing it's a weapon, which is kind of how we ended up where we are with basketball as a whole today (most leagues shooting more 3-pointers than ever with many teams using them as a cornerstone of success). 

Then again, it could just be a cultural or regional difference. I'm 36 years old and we grew up shooting (and hitting) lots of threes. It seems like organized basketball is just now catching up to what we were doing in pick-up games years ago.

That said, yeah, since the advent of the 3-point line there also always been guys shooting them who shouldn't be.

That means finding your best shooting path (the path that the ball will always travel in front of your body when getting into your shot), repeatable mechanics (don't have a hitch, preferably a one motion shot instead of two motion) and being able to replicate it properly (having your shoulder aligned to the net, having your hand on the middle of the ball, having feet set properly etc etc)

Of course neglecting ball handling is not good, but you can somewhat work on your handles right before you shoot to make sure you shoot in rhythm. (Like a 1-2 step shot or dribble a bit before going into a hop). It will help you have tighter handles and force you to work on your footwork to be able to shoot properly balanced jump shots.

Then set up cones or something similar in a line with about 4-5 feet in between each and practice doing these moves while moving through the cones. Do about 3-5 sets for each move (5-10 minutes depending on if you want to shoot a layup after each set which I recommend)

,,"If you are a baller then playing basketball and getting paid for it would be a dream come true.
It would be like winning the lottery.
But like winning the lottery only a very, very few people live that dream.

Basketball is so much more than a profession.  It is a beautiful game that has so many levels.

So many times I see this same question being asked on this sub and it makes me sad to think that someone like you would give up the game because the chances are you won't make it in the NBA.

Truth is a extremely high percentage of players won't make any professional leagues. 

But that doesn't matter. It's still a great game that can and will give back just as much or more than you put into it.

I think you should play as long and as hard as you can, but also don't neglect your studies. See were your game takes you.  Maybe it will just end up being something you do as a stress reliever that keeps you in great shape or maybe you will be good enough to be considered for a scholarship in college.  Whatever, at 12 you have no idea how good you will become or how much you will grow.

Play the game and try to be better tomorrow than you are today.
Go out for teams and see where it leads.  If you don't make the team its ok.  It's discouraging, but ok. Keep playing.   Even if you never make a school team there are other teams you can get on....city leagues, rec leagues or just pick up games. 

And there are also tons of jobs connected to basketball. So if you don't make it as a player you might consider coaching or physical therapy or basketball equipment sales or team doctor....it goes on and on.

I firmly believe that playing the game of basketball makes you a better person.  No matter what level. 

Be well rounded.  Play hard and study hard.

Good Luck

If you love playing don't stop, you will regret it if you do.

,,"People who are telling you to quit because you probably won't make it to the pros have the wrong idea about why one plays basketball. As almost everybody has mentioned here, you play it because you enjoy it.

But that is not all. Because at the end of the day, there are other enjoyable things as well and you give a lot of them up to spend more time with your academics, especially if you want to end up at a good college. Basketball is great for getting you into a good college even if you are an average but dedicated player.

First, there is the time commitment in your college application. Saying that you have spent 15+ hours a week for the last 10 years on something is impressive. It shows that you are capable of commitment.

But even more than that, playing basketball gives you so many more skills that are useful outside the court, that will eventually make you a great catch for a great college (if you have the right approach of course). 

Think about it. How many of your friends can get perform well after getting yelled at by a teacher? If you are a player, sometimes you will get humiliated by your coach in front of hundreds of your friends and family and you will get out there and perform anyway. How many of your friends will know how to be graceful both when winning and when losing? How many will know how to cheer for somebody wholeheartedly?

There is so much more to basketball than putting that ball through the hoop. So if you enjoy playing, keep playing. Even if you never win anything but play with the right attitude it will make you a better person and a better college applicant. If you are not sure about what the right attitude is, I highly recommend [Dick DeVenzio's Think Like a Champion](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Champion-Championship-Student-Athletes/dp/1933538546).",0,peopl tell quit probabl make wrong basketbal almost everybodi mention enjoy day enjoy thing well spend academ especi want good colleg basketbal great good colleg even averag dedic player first commit colleg applic say spent hour week year someth impress capabl commit even basketbal mani skill outsid court eventu make great catch great colleg approach think mani perform well teacher player sometim humili coach front hundr famili perform anyway mani know grace mani know cheer somebodi wholeheartedli much basketbal put hoop enjoy keep even never anyth attitud make better person better colleg applic sure attitud highli recommend devenzio think like champion http amazon think like champion championship student dp

Today I met a pro player at the court I practice at and he gave me a masterclass!,"So today I went to this little court I go to practice basketball (just to stay fit, and because I love the sport) (for clarification: I've never played more than high school level and have never practiced in a team, with a proper coach, routines etc. I always played with friends though, and tried to get it right and improve, but nothing serious. I started playing again in my 40's because it seemed a good way to stay fit and exercise outdoors)

So this dude comes around and starts shooting. I immediately see that he's very good. He starts nailing triple shots with perfect shooting form without any effort and I'm realizing the guy's a beast. So I go up and say hey, can I ask you for some advice?

I didn't want to interfere with his routine or training, I was just looking for a quick tip.

Have I learned to shoot incorrectly?,"Hi, I'm 23 and relatively new to basketball in the sense that I have not played in games much (only shooting around for fun). For a long time I've practiced shooting with one hand, where my hand comes out to my side (an L shape) kind of like a hook shot but I am facing the ring with my body. I did this originally as I could generate a lot of power as I am using my shoulder to catapult the ball into the air. The release feels really satisfying and smooth, and it is more accurate than when I shoot with two hands from any point on the court. 

My question is, someone has told me that it isn't good to shoot like that and I do not know what to do. How do I make something else feel comfortable? and how do I make sure to not learn the wrong thing?

I want to get better at basketball as I really love it and its fun (even though I am not that good). I don't even know where to find a coach to try get better, and YouTube has so many different shooting methods that it confuses me. Sorry if this didn't make any sense.

Street Ball Rules for Making a Basket after calling a Foul,"Recently I was playing basketball with some friends. I drove to the basket and was fouled while taking a layup, thus prompting me to call the foul in the middle of my shot. The layup proceeded to fall and I just assumed the bucket would count and I‚Äôd get the ball back (we were playing 2v2 winners ball). However, the opposing team was adamant that me calling foul (even before I made or missed the shot) negated the points scored. This made absolutely no sense to me because then are you supposed to just never call foul in hopes of making the basket and not negating it? Additionally it takes more skill and finesse to finish through a foul so the points are especially earned. In every other form of basketball you‚Äôre allowed to get a foul call and still try and finish the bucket if you‚Äôre in the shooting motion.

Dame has the most range. As for Trae, he made 9 out of 16 shots from 35 feet and beyond, Steph made 9 out of 111. Trae just finished his second season.

,,"[I wrote a post on it a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/ej25ur/coaches_corner_how_to_choose_your_springsummer/)

I've done a few posts on how to make your high school squad, now I want to focus on AAU/Grassroots/Club/Select specifically in North America.

Context: I will be speaking to boys and girls who are currently in grades 7-11 who intend to play college ball at some level.

It's the time of year (December/January) where grassroots teams are putting their rosters together and the whole system is wrought with misinformation because, for the better clubs, this is a business and they need to make money.

Let me start by defining the levels of club teams

**Elite shoe circuit**: These are limited in number by the three circuits (Nike, Adidas, Under Armor) with each having about 24 teams total. Their calendars are anchored by exclusive events happening during NCAA DI evaluation periods. These teams are generally put together on an invite-only basis and by this time of year their rosters are 80% locked. These teams also get prime draws and courts at open (non shoe circuit eval events) which means DI coaches are on the baseline.

**Elite non shoe circuit:** Since shoe circuits limit their teams there are also quite a few independent clubs that have elite teams that will get prime draws and courts at non-shoe events. They are just locked out of the shoe events. There are generally independent events in the same cities as the shoe events where these clubs play so college coaches can hit multiple events in one trip.

**Second tier elite:** Shoe circuit clubs and independent clubs have a group of lower tier teams and usually one of those is not quite elite but is close. For Nike and Under Armor their events don't have a place for these teams so they will play exclusively independent events. Adidas has a ""Gold"" level at their events so the second tier teams have a place to play. Independent clubs will bring their second tier team to the same eval events and put them in a lower bracket where they can still get some exposure.

**National Club:** This is where it starts to get a little shady in my opinion. This is the level where most clubs are just taking your money. Shoe and independent clubs have teams at this level. You pay full price to be on the team, $1,000 - $2,000, plus you have to cover travel expenses, do fundraisers, pay extra fees. Yes these teams get to national level eval events but they are generally on a terrible draw playing at the back of the gym or alternate site with zero coaches sitting on the baselines. These teams exist to cover the cost of the higher level teams as often the top team in club is full scholarship. National teams are also often too big with 12+ players.

**Regional Club:** These teams play a mix of local and regional events that they can drive to and generally don't require a hotel stay. Unless you are in Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Atlanta, DMV, or a few other locations these teams aren't playing at important Eval events and if they are, they are on courts/draws that aren't getting looks. This is purely developmental. If the price isn't too high it's a good place to be in 7-10 grade if you aren't a clear D1 prospect but maybe have your sights on D2, 3, NAIA. Avoid coaches that over-hype the looks you get at this level. Larger clubs with Elite teams often have teams at this level as well. In that context this functions as a developmental team for the upper level teams in the organization.

**Local Club:** Purely developmental teams that play in local events and leagues. Generally not playing in events that have college coaches attending. Focus is on skill development and making your high school team

**Dad team:** A ""club"" with one team coached by a player's dad who didn't like the local or regional club and thought they could do better. Effectively a local club but lacking a pipeline to higher level teams. Avoid this.

**Recreation Club:** You local rec league at the rec center or YMCA. Not somewhere you should be if you're in middle school or older and seriously thinking about playing at some college level.

So which level should you play on? Everyone wants to play at that elite level but not everyone is at that level. Even players that can and will play D1 ball don't necessarily need to be on an elite shoe team. There are about 1,000 scholarships at D1 level (Men and Women) every year and those elite levels have less players in each class than that so don't think being on that team is do or die. Plus those teams often have players headed to D2 and below.

I'd also like to point out that playing college ball at any level (D1, 2, 3 or NAIA) is a fantastic experience and a four year D2, 3 or NAIA player would come to your local pickup game and completely light up your gym. They are good players.

To simplify I'll break them down to three groups; national, regional, local.

**National:** (Elite, Non-shoe elite, 2nd tier elite) You should only play on a team that travels nationally if you are personally invited to be on the team or personally invited to try out. These teams will discover players at early season varsity tournaments so by now you should have already heard from them if they like you. If you have to shop yourself to a national level team you're probably not ready. If you do sign up for a lesser team there should be zero reason to do any overnight travel for events that are not during evaluation periods in major cities. For boys it's rare for Sophomore and below to be invited to these team. Occasionally I'll see an 8th grade girl who is ready for this level.

**Regional:** Are you a starter for your school team regardless of level but not yet getting invites to elite clubs? This is likely the level of team to be looking at. Price will be a consideration, coaching style, and practice/event schedule but the main thing I like to tell players is do not waste time on a team with more than 10 players. There is no point in paying money to sit on the bench. 8 or 9 players is ideal and 11 is a no go. You're here to get minutes.

**Local:** This is the place to be if you're looking to develop your game so pick a team that practices often. This is the place to be if you come off the bench for your school team and you're looking to get into the starting lineup. The key here is getting hours in the gym and minutes in games. My favorite local clubs are the ones that have access to their own gym(s).

It may seem early but now is the time to start planning your spring and summer. That's where you get better and get ready for the next level.",0,wrote post http reddit basketbal comment coach corner choos springsumm done post make high school squad want focu aau grassroot select specif north context speak current grade intend colleg level year decemb januari grassroot team put roster togeth whole system wrought misinform better busi need make start defin level team elit shoe circuit limit number circuit nike adida armor team total calendar anchor exclus event ncaa evalu team gener put togeth invit basi year roster team also draw court open shoe circuit eval event mean coach baselin elit shoe circuit sinc shoe circuit limit team also quit independ elit team draw court shoe event shoe event gener independ event citi shoe event colleg coach multipl event second tier elit shoe circuit independ group tier team usual quit elit close nike armor event place team exclus independ event adida level event second tier team place independ bring second tier team eval event put bracket still exposur start littl shadi opinion level take shoe independ team level price team cover travel expens fundrais extra fee team level eval event gener terribl draw gym altern site zero coach baselin team exist cover cost higher level team often top team scholarship team also often player region team mix local region event gener requir hotel stay unless vega dalla seattl atlanta dmv locat team import eval event court draw look pure development price high good place grade clear prospect mayb sight naia avoid coach hype look level larger elit team often team level well context function development team upper level team organ local pure development team local event leagu gener event colleg coach attend focu skill develop make high school team team team coach player like local region thought could better effect local pipelin higher level team avoid recreat local leagu center ymca somewher middl school older serious think colleg level level everyon want elit level everyon level even player necessarili need elit shoe team scholarship level everi year elit level player class think team team often player also like point colleg level naia fantast experi year naia player would come local pickup game complet gym good player simplifi group region local elit shoe elit tier elit team travel person invit team person invit team discov player earli season varsiti tournament alreadi like shop level team probabl readi sign lesser team zero reason overnight travel event evalu major citi rare sophomor invit team occasion see grade readi level region starter school team regardless level yet invit elit like level team look price consider coach practic event schedul thing like tell player team player point bench player ideal minut local place look develop game team practic often place come bench school team look start lineup hour gym minut game favorit local access gym may seem earli start plan spring summer better readi next level

You need to sacrifice lots of shorterm pleasures like sleep, hanging with people, girls, parties, and video games. Also when you workout you have to go at game speed b/c that is how games are played and if you arent used to playing that way then you will get outplayed by everyone else thus not standout to coaches and thus not get an offer. Also you should play in the eybl, adidas gaunlet, or under armour association b/c a majority of college coaches go to those games to offer players. There is a reason very few high school players have a college career, it is hard af even d2 or d3. When u workout there will be times that you feel like that this isnt for you, keep pushing because it will seem like a joke compared to college and the rewards (full ride scholarship, bond with teammates, travel the country/world, etc) is worth it. Also a very important video to watch is called ""6 keys to basketball training"" by ShotMechanics. It will give you very useful info in getting better. Since you are 6'3 you will have to be a guard. Some people may say that youre tall so play post but you are only tall relative to average male height in the USA (5'9) and you are short compared to college bball height however which may be 6'5 and up. Look up short players they got the best bag of moves Chris Paul, Zion Harmon, Sharife Cooper, Chris Lykes, 5'9 Isiah Thomas of the Celtics. Look up other players that have a great bag that are taller like Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bradley Beal. There are probably more so if I were you I would go to a bunch of basketball focused subreddits and comment sections all over the internet like IG, Twitter, and YouTube and ask them which players have the best moveset. You will get more examples. Another thing when youre training, people may ask you to play pickup then when u say no they may say playing by urself doesnt make you better. They are lying cuz they need an extra person or saying that cuz they dont know what theyre talking about. If you arent good then nobody will pass you the ball on offense and they will have you guard the easiest opposing player. Also you may spend a lot of time waiting ur turn to play and people barely try sometimes in pickup. Therefore pickup games dont get u better. You should use pickup games to test stuff youve been working on and as a measuring gauge for what you need to improve on. Keep in mind that you are not the only person trying to go d1, there are millions of people that dream of this and thousands of people putting in effort to get it.

With anything in life, work, school, sports, etc there is going to be some stress and fear. Fear you won't perform to your coach's/teammate's standards, but more importantly YOUR fear of not living up to your OWN standards. As time goes on we become more comfortable in what we do, but for me:

AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY AND YOUR'S ALONE YOU WILL SUCCEED IF YOU HOLD YOURSELF UP TO A HIGH STANDARD

Im not saying you should go out there and steal the ball away from your teammates, but believe in your ability to get out there and get to work. Be confident but not overzealous. Focus on making the right play and, in the end, you can walk away from a night where you had 0pts, 2reb, 1 ast, and 7 to's and be fine with it. Its a hard thing to master and a delicate balance. If you have confidence and trust all that work you put in, you'll do just fine. I believe in you, but more importantly believe in YOURSELF.

,,"Brother , I know exactly what you mean. You think you shouldn't take any shots or drives because your teammates can get it done or you think that you'll mess things up with the ball in your hand but I am here to tell you you gotta find the things your good at and do your best with them. 

By no means am I LeBron James or Stephen Curry but I found out that after daily practicing I can hit about 6/10 or my baseline mid-range jumpers. So I take those when ever I see the opportunity without hesitation. When I miss it's ok because I know I can possibly make 60% and the next one is definitely going in. In other words man, find your offense and stick to it. (Also, don't be scared to cut into the paint and possibly get blocked. Get those easy buckets, it helps your team out a bunch and it is the easiest way to score outside of a open fast break layup).

Lastly, on defense I feel you when you say people blow by you. I'm only 19 and my left knee is shot so getting low is something I have to ration. Like a trump card or a secret weapon. (The lower person between a defender and offensive player always wins the battle, so ""get low"" like Lil Jon said). My only tip on defense is to call ever thing out, be vocal. If you think someone is quick then yell out a switch, call for drive back up and if your man is a shooter call it out let everyone know that you know. If he likes driving left call it out and let it be known you know what he likes to do. If you wanna play up on him and breath on his neck tell your teammates so that when he drives past you they can pick up. All this saves you energy on defense and believe it or not it gets defense stops.

I don't recommend NeverFlats. I bought a NeverFlat because I wanted to save the $7 it would take to buy an air pump. NeverFlats are always overinflated (you won't get a friendly bounce off the rims, and other people won't want to play with your ball -- and you'll think you're better at dribbling than you actually are).

Basketball back pain injury,"  

I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. 

However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.

I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. 

I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). 

After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.

I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. 

I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. 

The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. 

I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. 

Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. 

I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. 

I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. 

**Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here‚Ä¶** 

I'll end with this‚Ä¶

My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology. It taught me that things are ever-changing, and it is essential to go with the flow, accept your situation, and figure out how and what you can learn from it.

,,"I don't know about the level of play in your league, but in our city rec leagues 6'2"" 190 will be on the big side. If this is true for you, teammates will love you if you focus on big men stuff on defense: rebound, help defense in the paint, etc. Even if you're relatively clueless, if you play hard on defense, respectable players will respect you.

As a smaller guard it really bugs me when bigs, or just players who don't shoot or drive well, float around the perimeter, mess up the spacing and passing lanes, and in turn make me less effective. As a beginner, you will be more effective for your team if you know your own game and limitations and play accordingly. If you are not comfortable shooting 3's or drive for more than 2 dribbles, the best places for you to be around the court are the low posts, high posts/elbow area, and the short corner/dunker's spots. These are prime real estate for bigs on offense, just rotating around those spots and trying to make a catch there will maximize your chances of doing something good. Some general rule of spacing: 1) if another one of your teammate is within 2-3 big strides of you (more if on the perimeter), then you're too close to each other: either cut away or politely tell your teammate to move; 2) don't be caught between a teammate and the basket (this takes away your teammate's option to drive to the basket), unless you're cutting/posting up for a layup: in which case, move away if you don't catch the pass. As a big you would be super useful to your team as a screener on and off the ball; if you don't know how or when or where to screen effectively, don't worry about it for now, but if you do, do it often and the guards on your team will buy you beers.

Other than that, make quick, decisive, simple plays. When your teammate has the ball, sprint hard to try and catch a pass, and sprint hard away if you don't get a pass. When you catch the ball, make quick decision to shoot (if you're open and in range), drive (if you're close enough and have a open lane to the basket), or pass (if you spot a open teammate). You pretty much want to either shoot/drive/pass immediately, or fake a shot/drive/pass first and then immediately shoot/drive/pass. The worst thing you can do, as a beginner, is to make a catch and then just hold onto the ball. You might think you're surveying for your options, but really this is just an opportunity for defender(s) to crowd you. More experienced players will see your inexperience and salivate at the chance to take advantage and try to make a steal whenever you have the ball (I know I would). But when you're quick and decisive with your play, even if you make the wrong read, you're keeping the ball moving and 1 step ahead of the defense, and allows your teammates to take advantage even if you cannot yourself. It will also be easier for you teammates to coach you up and figure out how you can best play well together as a team.

Small ball is generally used when the team plays a smaller lineup (usually by getting rid of the traditional center and have a PF play the 5. In Houston's case, they have a SF playing C lol)

You sacrifice size, low post offense/def for a smaller, quicker player for more speed, versatility and 3 point shooting (though a lot of bigs are extending their range to become more viable nowadays)

Essentially, the offensive pace gets faster (equals more shots) and the 3 point shooting gets better so you are able to create more space on the floor by drawing defenders out of the paint to defend the 3 point line.

,,"Freshman b-ball coach here. 

Many old-school coaches would probably disagree, but outside of free throw situations, I think box-out drills are overrated. The best rebounders can read and react to where the ball is going which is why baseball players often rebound well.

In terms of post moves, YouTube drop step and reverse pivot. If you can execute those fundamentals at try-outs your coaches will be impressed.

I‚Äôd also encourage you to try and be as versatile as possible and not limit yourself to a traditional power forward role. Practice dribbling and shooting with proper mechanics.

At try-outs an underrated thing I look for in kids is what type of energy they play with. Maybe that‚Äôs communicating on defense or hyping up a teammate in a scrimmage. Attitude goes a long way.

,,"I had the same problem as well, but I had injured my legs and had chronic muscle spasms that kept my quickness hidden. You have to do things like lunges and squats on the regular (I know you might get roasted by your peers but who gives af), and also stretch your hip flexers. If you have length, use it to your advantage. I had it, so I actually went against coaches and spread my legs xtra wide (b/c they just are) to cover more ground.

Fundamentally, the best tip I can give is if you are strong in your upper body, try to absorb their drives with your chest, but keep your hands back! So long as you keep your feet square, you're in good shape. My goal personally is to make the ball handler second guess themselves, so if I know I have long arms and am contesting and they see me talking smack and bumping them out position, they will try pump fakes and different extra moves.

PSA to all you young players out there. STOP WORRYING ABOUT VERT! I am. It saying don‚Äôt train your legs to be strong and to explode. But I promise promise promise you should know that vert is one of the easier things to get and one of the least important parts to a good player,"
Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  

Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6‚Äô6‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt hurt but he isn‚Äôt jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  

I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you‚Äôll gain vert. It‚Äôs that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time.

How to improve game?",,0,normal dribbl basketbal look slightli dribbl basketbal dont look defend look slightli floor realli see feet kinda easier dribbl better handl trick better alittl vision improv game
,,"Well I would say it‚Äôs normal when your still in the beginning range when it comes to dribbling. Once you start getting more adept and comfortable with dribbling basic combinations like between the legs, crossovers, in and outs, behind the back( that‚Äôs a move where u can‚Äôt look at the ball LOL)  &amp; other more skilled combinations u won‚Äôt need to look at the ball. Every expert would tell you that in a high level games like team games or even 1v1‚Äôs that u always should be able to look up. For spacial awareness, court awareness and ect. Esp team games where awareness of where your opponents and teammates are is huuuge. If you want to increase your overall b-ball I.q and be a better passer and playmaker. This is something u have to master. People who have to look down while dribbling can be a major crutch for your team.‚Äù, like missing cutters, passing lanes and other teamates who are in perfect spots to get the ball or who are open. Opponents.‚Äù, esp good defenders can easily take advantage of that and use u as a liability. Don‚Äôt get me wrong every now and again depending on the move even High level NBA and elite players would look down at the ball, sometimes it‚Äôs necessary. But being able to have the best ball control you can, training yourself to dribble without looking down will put u in the best place to be to take your game to the highest level.  Another thing that‚Äôs huge is slashing, if you want to become the best slasher u can be, then mastering dribbling without looking down is one of the first things, because watching where your defender is and countering where they move when you use dribble combinations will let you take advantage of those gaps to drive to the lane. For me I had to work on my ball control a lot to become the slasher that I am today. Esp since I was never comfortable dribbling the ball since I was a shooter. So I had to work on my weaknesses, and that was one of the first things I targeted.


I advise you to play with cones and other non moving objects while working on your drives to get better at ball control and not needing to look down when you execute combinations. Try switching in different directions while you dribble, and moves like hesitations, stopping and moving with the ball &amp; In time you won‚Äôt be doing it at all, looking up will be first nature.",0,well would say normal still begin come dribbl start adept comfort dribbl basic combin like crossov behind move look skill combin need look everi expert would tell high level game like team game even alway look spacial awar court awar esp team game awar oppon teammat huuug want increas overal better passer playmak someth peopl look dribbl major crutch team like miss cutter pass lane teamat perfect open oppon esp good defend easili take advantag liabil wrong everi depend move even high level nba elit player would look sometim necessari control train dribbl without look put place take game highest level anoth thing huge slash want becom slasher dribbl without look first thing watch defend counter move dribbl combin take advantag gap lane work control becom slasher today esp sinc never comfort dribbl sinc shooter work weak first thing target advis cone move object work better control need look combin switch differ direct dribbl move like hesit stop move look first natur

Standing Jump Higher than Running Jump,"Note: TL;DR at bottom

Hi everyone. Before I explain my issue, here‚Äôs some information about me:

Today, I got a basketball hoop after being without one for a couple years due to moving across the country. I‚Äôm in my late teens, and I‚Äôve grown a lot since the last time I played basketball. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 now, and I decided I wanted to try learning how to dunk. 

I called one of my friends who regularly plays basketball and has been trying to dunk for a while now (he‚Äôs about 6‚Äô0.5). He told me to show him my standing jump, and I was able to touch the rim (10ft hoop), but not higher. He then told me to try getting a running start to increase my vert. I did, and I kept reaching a couple inches below the rim at my peak height. Can anyone give me some tips so I can gain some inches on my running jump instead of losing a couple of inches? Thanks.

TL;DR: 6‚Äô4. Just started trying to dunk. Can touch rim on 10ft hoop with standing jump. Can‚Äôt touch rum on running jump. Can anyone give me tips on how to go higher with running jump? Thanks.

Note: My hoop is on a slight incline of about 2-3 degrees so that might affect it, but that shouldn‚Äôt make my running jump lower than my standing right?",,0,stand jump higher jump note bottom everyon explain issu inform today basketbal hoop without coupl year due move across countri teen grown sinc basketbal decid want learn dunk regularli basketbal dunk told stand jump touch ft hoop higher told start increas kept reach coupl inch peak height anyon tip gain inch jump instead coupl inch thank start dunk touch ft hoop stand jump touch jump anyon tip higher jump thank note hoop slight inclin degre might affect make jump stand

,,Get strong Here in Mexico we never play in street with fouls and often we play for money so its indeed a very tough and psysical sport.,0,strong mexico never street foul often inde tough psysic sport
,,"*I got carried away writing this, but the gist of my comment is in* ***bold****.*   


Organized and even professional basketball is a contact sport, especially street-ball. Soon, you'll learn to love the struggle and physicality of the game and get addicted to the sensation of grabbing a highly-contested rebound or getting one on a dog of a defender. I'm not as tall as you are, but as somebody considered to be a big man where I'm from, I can only suggest that you either **nut up or shut up**.   


If you're still here and want technical advice, I suggest you **determine the type of play-style you prefer**. I understand that the trend nowadays is to be as versatile a player as you can be, but it's more logical to start with a base and go from there. You're tall in your group, but maybe not enough for formal basketball, so you can play as a point guard which means that you will want to improve your passing and dribbling. Your teammate's inadequacies cannot be helped, but, as a PG, it will be your job to find them in their high-percentage spots and give them the opening they need. Based on what you said, the defense collapses around you which means that your mates should have enough space to make a move. If you're agile enough, you might not get hurt as much since you're playing outside (although these are just my observations as somebody who regularly gets clobbered inside, I might be jaded).   


Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, **get strong**. Hit the weight room and load up on protein. No matter what you do, you will get hit in this sport. The objective of basketball as a defender is to confront the offense and prevent getting scored on. On the other hand, the objective of the offense is to confront the defense and score. Physicality is in the nature of a sport about two groups trying to defeat the other. Do not be naive and think you can avoid getting hit, there have been cases in my games where somebody would get a broken nose after getting elbowed and still keep going. That said, the goal of getting strong is not only to be able to take a hit or hit back, but to prevent and minimize the injuries you will sustain. You will have sore arms from working out, but if you fail to get stronger, you might also end up with a broken bone on top of being ineffective as a player.",0,carri away write gist comment bold organ even profession basketbal contact sport especi street soon learn struggl physic game sensat grab highli contest rebound defend tall somebodi consid suggest either shut still want technic advic suggest determin type prefer understand trend nowaday versatil player logic start base tall group mayb enough formal basketbal point guard mean want improv pass dribbl teammat inadequaci cannot help pg high percentag open need base said defens collaps around mean enough space make move agil enough might hurt much sinc outsid although observ somebodi regularli clobber insid might lastli cannot stress enough strong weight room protein matter sport object basketbal defend confront offens prevent score object offens confront defens score physic natur sport group defeat naiv think avoid case game somebodi would broken nose elbow still keep said goal strong take prevent minim injuri sustain sore work stronger might also broken top ineffect player

To increase your power you need to get faster and/or stronger. Basically increasing explosiveness. There are many exercises you can do to increase explosiveness in your legs. You can do pause squats, depth jumps, running at top speed. You basically want to mix it up with exercises that are on the heavy side to gain more strength, but be doing a explosive thing at the same time, such as pause squats. You also want to be doing something that trains speed, like depth jumps or running. A mic of both will increase your vert a lot.

,,"Increasing your vertical mainly comes from heavy weight leg workouts and plyometrics. Depending on your leg strength that should decide weather you should do leg workouts or plyometrics more. I think the general rule of thumb is that if your max squat is less 1.5 times your body weight, then you should focus mainly on increasing leg strength, but if it's over then you should focus more on plyometrics.

I recently changed up my leg workout to help me increase strength more effectively, and I'd recommend you do these workouts too if you want to increase leg strength and jump higher.

Squats - for overall leg strength, especially quads, Calf raises - for calves, Straight Leg Deadlifts - for hamstrings, Hip thrusts - for glutes, and split squats - kind of overalll leg strength again. You can research into doing these workouts properly. To increase strength you want higher weight and lower reps, I tend to do 4 sets of 6 reps for basically everything.

You should know also that your overall body strength is more important to jumping higher than you might realise. Particularly, a strong back and hips will help increase your vert. So deadlifts are very important.

Long story short yes squats and calf raises are important. Squats are especially important because of how much they do for your legs. Also depending on if you're a one or two foot jumper, I'd imagine calf raises would be extra beneficial if you're a single leg jumper because that jump uses your calves more.",0,increas vertic mainli come heavi weight workout plyometr depend strength decid weather workout plyometr think gener rule thumb max squat bodi weight focu mainli increas strength focu plyometr recent chang workout help increas strength effect recommend workout want increas strength jump higher squat overal strength especi quad calf rais calv straight deadlift hamstr glute squat kind overall strength research workout properli increas strength want higher weight tend set basic everyth know also overal bodi strength import jump higher might realis particularli strong help increas deadlift import stori squat calf rais import squat especi import much also depend jumper imagin calf rais would extra benefici singl jumper jump calv

When you are training you will need to discipline yourself a lot. Always go at game speed when u train and train hard af so that the game gets easier for you. From a bball standpoint you are short so you will have to have a great bag of moves, be fast, and be a decent perimeter defender.

Work on your timing, and you‚Äôll gain a couple inches once your body figures out the best way to approach the rim.

Hey i want some advice for my position,"First of all i'm korean so plz understand me for my poor english skills

I'm 5'11 tall and my wingspan is similar to my height i'm pretty muscular so i played as a small forward or sometimes undersize Pf when i was in high school and i'm just a amateur not a pro

Recently i participated a basketball club where guys play just for fun 

The old members asked me about my position and i said i'm sf

Then they told me i'm a bit small for a sf( normally in korea pg-5'9 sg-5'11 sf-6'1 pf-6'3 C-6'5 and above for amateurs)

And they suggested me to play as a oversize pointguard or shooting guard cuz i have height advantage as a pg and i may have problem guarding opponent sf with my size

But the problem is i'm not a 3-point shooter. my favorite spot is elbow or 0-15feet midrange shots and drive in finished with layups

And i'm 25 yrs old so i don't think i can learn to play as a guard since i played most of the games as a forward 

Do you think i should learn to play as a guard since i can have height and strength advantage? Or should i just keep playing as a forward cuz i'm used to it

Let‚Äôs discuss.,"Anthony Davis.
Over-rated.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong.
Hear me out.
Individually, he is great and his stats state that.
Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.
Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn‚Äôt be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn‚Äôt embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that‚Äôs like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus. So, the credit is due and he is yet to earn his due. #Facts",,0,discuss anthoni davi wrong individu great state team wise much media hype great player much take yesterday chanc step deliv earn respect teammat peer make impact game harden team mvp rest team equal match accord also problem consid davi still young score okc embarrass enough alreadi kept game least loss also lebron assist game like point game depend lebron lead provid good game matter also speak new orlean never made playoff compar legend multipl championship disrespect real legend game arguabl critic bogu credit due yet earn due fact

,,"List 1: (3 sets, 3-5 reps)

Explosive movements: rim jumps, box jumps, depth jumps

List 2: (3-4 sets, 4-8 reps)
Loaded explosive movements: jump squat, broad jumps, skiers 

List 3: 
3-4 sets, 10-20 reps:

Reactive movement: Ankle hops, line jumps


Pick an exercise off each of the lists. 

This will help build explosive power, and help your body become more reactive and more capable of converting the strength you have into vertical explosion. 

For rest periods that will depend on you. Your objective should be to be fully recovered before each set for anything off list 1, it's about exploding off the group with maximum power for each rep. That's also why reps are so low there. Similar sort of goes for list 2, however you don't really want to be resting for 3+ minutes or anything like that for those. 

List 3 exercises can have lower rest. Like 1-2 minutes

For rep count, if you notice the quality of your reps diminishing significantly, or for things on list 1 basically at all, then that means your set is over. That's what exercises on list 2 and 3 are for. You want to hit it full power, full performance, so as to keep expanding the power you can exert. 

-

Core strength will also help you a lot, preferably exercises in the lower rep range. So not doing 50 crunches, more like 10-15 leg lifts. Pick 3-4 exercises for 3-4 sets and try to really hit them with full reps

Then at the power forward position, it becomes important to find the space around the perimeter and get your feet set and ready to shoot. Try to focus on keeping your balance. A lot of times after you pop you are moving laterally and it is difficult to shoot with good balance. Same situation for after setting a back screen, or rotating to the corner after a drive. All your momentum is going a different direction and you need to use your feet to transfer it toward the basket to shoot consistently. 

For starters, when practicing shooting, use the same footwork every time. Whatever is most comfortable for you, a hop, left-right, or right-left. Getting your balance consistent will help you knock them down when you are open. In addition to your deep game, being able to attack the rim with one or two dribbles (after a shot fake or head fake) is another great skill to work on and will make you a lot tougher to defend.

 It is tough to sit out especially if other people or your team has decided to start backup again. But you should recognize that your health is very important.

 As a 15 year old you should continue to work on ball handling regardless of your height or position.
 Hopefully you have space somewhere in your house or near your house where you can really push yourself to increase your dribbling speed and work on adding more dribbling ball handling moves to your bag.

,,"(Copying a previous answer of mine with some tweaks) 

Based off your elevation, I would say you need ~2-3 inches to get your first dunk, probably from someone throwing it up for you or you bouncing it really high. However at ~4-5 inches I see you as very comfortably being able to dunk 1 foot or 2 foot when fully stretched out with one hand. To gain these inches, I would suggest looking up some online vert workout videos. I personally used the combo of Andrew Lloyd and Isaiah Rivera's YouTube videos (The first for strength, the second for stretches and plyometrics). You should see really good results by ~7 weeks if not sooner. Another important key is your jump technique as I see you kind of slow down near the end which isn't ideal, Isiah can really help with that as well.

100 left hand mid height (to the knee)

50 left hand high (above the waist)

100 right hand mid height (to the knee)

Do that for 30 days, then come back for more.  EXTREMELY important to be in a squated/knees bent position and to keep your head up not look at the ball.

Well I want to ask first, is your ball handling with both hands pretty good? Because doing any type of hesitation move requires great ball control/ball manipulation. If you have that I‚Äôll give you some pointers. To do hesis you must sell it with your eyes. If you‚Äôre doing a hesi where you hang the ball on your hand for a sec, you look at the opposite direction of where the ball is currently in your hand. So if it‚Äôs on your left hand you look to the right then explode left. Your right foot will be the one pushing off with your left foot being a forward. You get what I‚Äôm saying? That‚Äôs one type of hesitation but you get the point. Also, having a good core helps. I forgot what the video was but I remember someone saying that having a good core is a must when looking to become a faster ball handler.

1. conditioning is key. Can you run 10 minute miles? That‚Äôs just a start. But start timing your runs and see how long it takes to run 3, 4, and 5 miles. This is only to start training your mind to stay engaged after a long run. Basketball is about sprints however so throw those in as well.

2. attitude is everything. Ask questions when you can. Prove to your coaches that you‚Äôre there to learn. The more you‚Äôll learn, the more you‚Äôll realize you don‚Äôt know so skip the painful lessons now and just recognize that you‚Äôre about to (hopefully) embark on this long and wonderful journey. Have a good attitude.

3. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúshoot around.‚Äù You have to practice in game scenarios at full effort/speed. There‚Äôs an app called Home Court and tons of YouTube trainers. These drills will help you know what to practice which was what I struggled with at your age.

A lot of kids consider the tryouts and preseason as the time to get in shape. So show up in as close to game shape as possible. Shows you care and are serious.

So before the pandemic started, I wasn't that good at basketball. I was okay, but nowhere near my friend's level. Ever since the pandemic started, I've been going out to my local courts at 6:30 am and working out for an hour and a half. I can tell I've really improved and my friends noticed it too.

,,You have to warm up correctly before playing - every single time.  Show up early if you need to.  When practicing you also warm up and then find yourself around a half dozen spots on the floor and shoot from only those spots.  Just make sure you get your numbers in at each spot.  The spots many people shoot from are the corner 3 and about 15 foot along the baseline.  Then there is the top of the key and free throw line shot.  Then there is the free throw line extended 3.  That's pretty much it. You can allot maybe 30 minutes to an hour.  I'd start out trying at least 20 shots per spot. I normally did 50-100 per spot.

Just watched my first Jordan game and I'm in awe,"I've been watching basketball for years but never stopped to watch an entire game from the man himself (or any old/legendary game), and today I decided to do just that, a 55 point MJ one against the Knicks (Ewing was amazing too) and not only the game dynamic was different, it flowed a LOT better, as there were fewer pauses and fouls, there was more *game* in the game, and Michael's playing is out of this universe

I'm amazed on how different (and in many ways, better) basketball was in general. Even the broadcast and image were a surprise, it had a certain glare, and the crowd, soundtrack, and the overall scheme was so surprising, it was a beauty to look at, visually, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen, it's stunning. 5 hours later, I'm watching a Rockets x Bucks game and I can't help but feel that ""it's great but not the same thing"" feel in the back of my head (the absence of a crowd doesn't help a bit). 

I know we have the second best ever with LeBron today, but it's like something was lost with time, it doesn't get as ""grand"" as this old Bulls X Knicks game felt to me. Idk.

If you feel like it, recommend some legendary games for me to try and find through the internet to increase my knowledge of the greats before the 2000s",,0,watch first jordan game awe watch basketbal year never stop watch entir game legendari game today decid point knick amaz game dynam differ flow better fewer paus foul game game michael univers amaz differ mani better basketbal gener even broadcast imag surpris certain glare crowd soundtrack overal scheme surpris beauti look visual prettiest thing ever seen stun hour later watch game help feel great thing feel absenc crowd help know second ever lebron today like someth lost grand knick game idk feel like recommend legendari game internet increas knowledg great

But yes, the 90s were a great time for the NBA's popularity. Not only did you have superstars that were a huge departure from the 80s style in Shaq, MJ, Penny, etc, but I think the league took a huge step forward culturally, especially in marketing itself to kids. Think of the impact NBA Jam had. It definitely took a dip after Jordan's final year with the Bulls and continued probably until Lebron's Cavs 1.0 teams were NBA Finals level goods. The early and mid 2000s seems like a black hole of one-on-one ball, low scoring, and criminal records. It was a sad state of affairs that late round playoff games were played in the 70s and 80s.

You can have your personal preferences towards the 90s, but I like where the NBA is now.  The players have adapted to stricter fouling rules. No more can teams win by simply out-strengthing the opposition. The skill level is through the roof today. Positionless basketball has opened the door for skill and strategy to take over.

,,"It‚Äôs all about efficient energy transfer. You don‚Äôt have to be Popeye the Sailor to shoot jumpers. Some tips on efficiently shooting a basketball:

1. Keep your entire body loose but poised. Any stiffness will sap away energy while shooting. 

2. Do not stop the ball while bringing it from your set point to your shooting form. You wouldn‚Äôt stop swinging a golf club right before it hits the ball, then strike it from a stop, right? So when shooting a basketball keep the momentum going and make it one swift, fluid motion.

3. Don‚Äôt lean forward too much. Keep your back comfortably upright, but tip your body forward (oxymoron, I know) ever so slightly so the weight is on the balls of your feet. Now when your bend your legs a bit and jump, your body will be straight and all the force your apply to the ground will bounce right back to propel you up (Newton‚Äôs third law)

4. A short but springy jump is better than a long-winded and weak jump. Don‚Äôt bend your legs too much, but once it‚Äôs bended jump with a powerful force. Time this brief but strong jump with your upper body release. This way your jump takes as much time as your release but still contributes a large impulse (impulse = time * force. To get the same impulse as a long-winded jump, you gotta shorten the time and increase the force. A smaller knee bend helps

5. Finally, practice! Muscle memory will power your shot more than any amount of time in the weight rooms.

,,"I‚Äôve always been a good shooter but it took me about 4 years from when I started practicing it to get there. The main secret is confidence in your shot, take the shot because you know you‚Äôll make it not because you can. But the basic things I can tell you is shoot everyday till you‚Äôre to tired to shoot, try working from 300 shots a day to 500 and keep going up. Pick different spots on the court and shoot 20-30 reps from each spot and pick 10-15 spots a session. Practice ‚Äúgame shots‚Äù like pull up jumpers, shooting coming around a pick, creating jump shots off only 3 dribbles, pick spots around the 3 pt line and do 30-45 reps in each spot. I‚Äôve practiced with some friends that played college ball who had great strokes and they would make me practice shooting from 10 feet out to build my strength up. You have to familiarize yourself and build muscle memory from every distance/angle/situation/location on the court so that you can always find yourself in a well practiced position. 
This is all assuming that you have your firm down. Not every video on shooting form works for everyone because not everyone‚Äôs jump shots will look the same. I picked my favorite shooters to watch and learned from them watching YouTube and games. I learned good base and foundation for my shoot from MJ and Kobe/ I took my follow through and flick from JJ reddick and ray allen/ and I tried to practice all of it until I could shoot with a release as quick as Reggie miller‚Äôs and ray allens.

Everybody in the world wants to bomb from the cheap seats, but it's the fundamentals you get from shooting close in that will guide you to deeper success. My favorite drill? Play ""Around the World"" from 3 ft away and see how many swishes you can get in a row while making SURE you hold your follow-through every shot. This drill sounds dumb but I promise you it isn't.

Your jumpshot is all about form. If you're starting out with poor form, it will only get worse as you increase your range. Your legs and your core will help you extend your distance, so be sure to focus on your bottom half when strength training.

Thing is if you are an active person who isn't injured and is at a normal weight, your chances of tearing your achilles is VERY low.

How do I develop a healthy relationship with basketball?,"At this point, I've really accepted that I'm addicted. Basketball and just working out in general have been my escape from everything, from the demands of life. It's the only place that I feel healthy tbh. Basketball's the only place where I've made friends that are real friends who I could really connect with. It's the only tim I felt like I'm alive and my life feels awesome cause of it. Sure, the road is full of challenges. Sure, I don't have the talent to make it to that level I always fantasize about. But basketball's something that reminds me that not everything is full of shit. It's that one thing, that constant challenge that helps fill this emptiness inside of me. 







But I gotta come clean today. If I had control over my life like that, maybe I'd be able to have a healthier relationship. But sometimes you don't and you feel that craving. ""It was supposed to be this way but it wasn't that way and you can't do anything about it."" If I got to hoop during all those missed opportunities, maybe life would be different. But I always get that reminder everyday that my life is _not_ about basketball and it constantly gets me to ask ""why?"" I always daydream about what it would be like if I were some hotshot in the league living the good life. 







I always get that reminder everyday that I'm not good enough. I play like it sometimes. I look good sometimes. But I'm barely good enough to even make varsity. I could, but with all this covid bullshit, maybe not this time. Some of it's on me. Mentally, my game is not always in the right place, and the reality is I suck. I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. 







It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play. Unfortunately, it's always gotta be that stuff I can't control getting in the way. And that's what really does make me upset and addicted.







Sorry I wasted everyone's time here. I really needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it's the fact that life's returning to normal over here. More school, more house chores, more family, and less basketball. I felt it. I felt it in quarantine, myself getting better. But today, I lost it. I lost all the confidence I had built up for months. I just don't feel the same anymore, and maybe it's because I wanna go back to the days of working out 2-3 times a day instead of once.

A lot of people get bad ankle and knee injuries from the impacts of landing so working on your landing will help avoid those injuries as much as possible.

If you're landing properly, that is adequately absorbing the impact of the descent of your jump, you'll find you have to activate more muscles in your legs to stabilize everything. Once you're body gets used to using these muscle fibres to land, they'll also be more available for when you take off. The more muscle fibres you can recruit, the more strength and power your muscles have available, leading to high jumps.

"6'6, hoping to increase vertical, build explosiveness, and utilize my height","I played basketball as a kid growing up but stopped in middle school as I had focused on other sports. However, I've been hoping to get back into it and I am realizing that despite being 6'6 I have virtually no vertical (can grab rim but that's it) and lack the power and explosiveness to really improve my game. Also, since the last time I played basketball I was like 12 years old and I never learned how to properly utilize my height. 

Some background: 20M, 6'6 and about 180 pounds which is pretty skinny. I consider myself ""in shape"" because I am a runner usually doing 45-90 minute runs at a decent pace, however this type of fitness is not helping me with my vertical or overall explosiveness. Most of my runs are aerobic but I occasionally do some faster paced anaerobic training.

I have heard that losing weight is helpful for improving vertical but due to running I don't have much weight to lose in the first place. My current plan includes increasing my calorie intake so I am actually gaining weight, as well as bodyweight workouts like jump squats and box jumps. I'm also hoping to spent time reading and watching videos about big man and power forward roles, as well. I want to focus more on ""quick twitch"" muscle development because right now my exercise is ""slow"" muscle work and endurance training.

Are there some other things I should focus on or think about as I begin trying to improve my game? Any general advice about getting back into basketball would be greatly appreciated as well.

,,"Father Time is undefeated, but athletic decline after 30 is overblown. You can still maintain or improve your strength and conditioning levels with intelligent training. Likewise, you can still improve your skillset and sport intelligence. Those two factors should more than make up for any athletic decline due to advanced age, resulting in either same or improved overall sport performance.

Also, ""decline after 30"" is mostly narrative-driven, and not strongly supported by research. There is probably an inflection point at which athleticism begins to decline, but given interpersonal differences in training history, genetics, and skill, it's nearly impossible to point to 1 point in time where everything goes downhill, and really, not worth worrying about.

In fact, that narrative is probably more harmful than any biological changes. Think about everything you hear relating to age and performance. ""It's over after 30,"" ""Your body just breaks down/isn't the same,"" ""Stretch, you'll be glad when you're older."" That's a powerful nocebo - you expect to feel worse after 30, so you do. When in reality, there's no measurable difference between the day before and day after your 30th birthday.

The overall decline matters for elite athletes, where every fraction of a second is magnified because everyone is a goddamn freak of nature. But even then, we are now seeing NBA athletes extend their careers well into their 30s.

So, what should you do? Stop spreading the myth of ""decline after 30."" It's not true (not in any meaningful way), and it's a harmful narrative for you and your friends. 

Just go about your business and continue to kick ass and take names. Keep training, keep competing with the expectation of excellence. Better nutrition is probably a good idea (limit processed foods, red meats, sat fats, eat lots of fruits and veggies). Resistance training has tons of health benefits, beyond sport performance.

Shooting: Try Steve Nash's 20 minute shooting workout.

Finishing: Work on acrobatic layups, since your a point guard, centers will have it easy blocking you unless you find a way to manipulate the ball in midair.

So you do some transverse (not directly to the basket but in the right direction) dribble to one side while covering the ball with your body, then a crossover and then you repeat the same thing on the other side with the other hand until you are near the basket for an easy throw, lay up, hook or any post move. 

This doesn't look flashy or utterly skilled but it gets the job done and forces the defender to play REAL defense and not just random steals. Since I am not a small and fast player I have been relying on this for many years now and I usually win my 1vs1 matches.

If you are the small/fast guy you probably have to get even faster, dribble the ball lower and have to change the rhythm of your dribbles (varying speed and bounce height of the ball) so that you are less predictable.

,,"AAU parent and coach here.
 In the  USA AAU is a basketball league for young people (8yr old to 18).

 It is considered generally the league where are you can find the highest level of youth competition and basketball.
 Its main function yes obviously besides making money off of parents who swear their kids are going to get drafted in the NBA tomorrow,  Is to provide kids an opportunity to compete in basketball that is outside of their school or local club team both of which typically do not offer elite competition.

 For high school students kids age 14 through 18 it has become an almost required path if you were actually trying to obtain D1 college scholarship.

However  it is possible to just play on your high school team and still get AD1 scholarship- most likely to your local college but not any top tier bball college (Duke, Kentucky etc) 
But this would mean you would not get national exposure and you'd have to be really really dominant on your high school team playing other dominant high school teams.
 And if that is the case in the United States trust me AAU coaches will be pushing hard to that kid's parents to join their team.

 I'm sure others will get into the bashing of AAU believe me its organization full of humans. So you can expect it to be filled with politics, drama, money grabbing behaviors and misguided agendas.

,,"Sounds like your transition will be mostly on the offensive side as you'll still have to defend the opposing bigs. If you are a reasonably athletic forward you likely have a speed/quickness advantage on the bigger players defending you.

So, offensively I would advise improving your ball handling as is a skill that is useful no matter what.  If you can also improve your perimeter shooting (3pt shot?) then you can be a very tough guard for a big man.

You make your defender (likely their big) choose to either:
1. Sag off of you on the perimeter, and then you can bury open 3pt shots and run pick and pop action.
2. Step out to guard you on the perimeter and you go by your defender  on the dribble.

I would also advise you to focus on your free throw shooting.  If you become a mismatch offensively for teams they may be forced to play zone.  Most zone offenses attempt to attack the FT line.  Plus improving your foul shooting is never a bad thing.

How to be more aggressive,"So I (27) never played in any organized basketball. No middle school no high school no college. I‚Äôve only ever played pick up. I never took it serious until this year with everything getting shut down I figured it was the perfect time to get my skills up. My shot has drastically improved. I was always the guy pulling up from 3 with terrible form. I seem to have found my range (post &amp; mid range mostly)  &amp; when I‚Äôm in a groove can extend to the 3. However obviously I‚Äôm not Steph Curry and sometimes I just can‚Äôt buy a bucket. Because of my history of being a terrible shooter, whenever my shots aren‚Äôt falling, I lose confidence &amp; it‚Äôs essentially game over on the offensive side for me. And if my shots aren‚Äôt dropping the defense sags off &amp; clogs any open lanes. When I‚Äôm in a rhythm I have no difficulty slashing or cutting, but I can‚Äôt seem to get aggressive &amp; go to the bucket if my J‚Äôs don‚Äôt fall. How do I get over this hump? I still have to keep working on my game &amp; improve my shooting &amp; I work on it. But I just can‚Äôt seem to get over this issue. I‚Äôm definitely not a ball hog but I want to be efficient &amp; not hurt my team with bricks or nervously attacking then getting the ball ripped. I know confidence comes from putting in the work.

Basketball with injuries,"I‚Äôve recently decided I will be starting a more in depth training programme in order to outwork the players around me and eventually be a more complete player.

If so what could I do in the mean time in order to still work on my basketball for example increase my IQ by watching a few games a day etc.

,,"&gt;Over the summer, though, having broken the original bubble ‚Äì lockdown was over, players had more time to get out, they had been on holiday and children returned to school, although footballers were advised not to pick them up ‚Äì studies suggested the dressing room was where the virus was most likely to be transmitted. An enclosed space, occupied for prolonged periods, that was where a single positive could spread to the squad. So they were shut.

&gt;Osasuna offered one solution when they set up outdoor showers at their Tajonar training ground ‚Äì four of them a safe distance apart ‚Äì but the weather got colder and that didn‚Äôt last long. Players everywhere were told to arrive and leave training in their kit, showering at home, and that is applied to matches too. League inspectors, who change periodically to ensure they don‚Äôt get too close to the teams they‚Äôre observing, travel with every squad to ensure they comply, which doesn‚Äôt always happen and certainly not willingly.

&gt;Access to the dressing room pre-game is limited to leaving bags and getting out again ‚Äì ‚Äúthree minutes and the clock‚Äôs running‚Äù, as one assistant coach puts it. Teams do their activation work ‚Äì warm-ups, stretching, treatment ‚Äì at the hotel, and change in their own rooms. Most teams are now turning up at the ground only 40 minutes before kick-off, going straight on to the grass. At half-time, only the starting XI and the manager are allowed in, and only briefly. ‚ÄúTo change, if there are any ‚Äòneeds‚Äô and that‚Äôs about it,‚Äù one staff member says. At the end, there are five minutes or so. Most hang around the tunnel or the pitch post-game, which they can do more easily in an empty stadium. There‚Äôs a post-kickabout feel to it, footballers chatting away. Those who didn‚Äôt play, train.

&gt;No one can shower, unless they‚Äôre a player taken off in the first half and alone in the dressing room. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt change at the ground, not at home or even away,‚Äù Joaqu√≠n says. The visiting team get back on the bus or busses: there are supposed to be two of them. They do so still in their kit ‚Äì although they‚Äôre given dry tops and towels ‚Äì and they are taken back to the hotel to change. Treatment must wait until then, too. They get out as quick as they can. On Wednesday, Atl√©tico‚Äôs bus had pulled away within 16 minutes of the final whistle of their 0-0 draw, leaving Diego Simeone behind to do the press conference.

&gt;Some limited solutions have been sought, aided by the absence of fans. Valladolid erected a dressing-room equivalent of a field hospital behind the seats, allowing air to pass through and a couple of players at a time to warm down, stretch or be treated. Stadium passages have been adapted to provide warm-up areas. Benches and seats are placed in gangways. At C√°diz, the Osasuna manager, Jagoba Arrasate, gave his final team talk in the open-air like a basketball coach courtside.",1,gt summer though broken origin lockdown player holiday return school although footbal advis studi suggest dress room viru like transmit enclos space occupi prolong singl could squad shut gt osasuna offer solut set outdoor tajonar train ground safe distanc apart weather colder player everywher told arriv leav train home appli match leagu inspector chang ensur close team observ travel everi squad ensur compli alway certainli willingli gt access dress room game limit leav minut clock assist coach put team activ work warm stretch treatment hotel chang room team ground minut kick straight grass half start manag briefli chang need staff member say five minut hang around pitch post game easili empti stadium post kickabout feel footbal chat away train gt unless player taken first half alon dress room chang ground home even away joaqu say visit team buss suppos still although given top taken hotel chang treatment must wait wednesday atl tico pull away within minut final whistl draw leav diego simeon behind press confer gt limit solut sought absenc valladolid dress room equival field hospit behind pass coupl player warm stretch treat stadium passag adapt provid warm area bench place gangway diz osasuna manag jagoba arras gave final team talk open like basketbal coach courtsid

Therefore, the sporting director position is even more critical for PSG. 
The only real solution imho is finding ways to make the ligue 1 more attractive, increase revenues (e.g. attracting neymar to bump the TV rights so all clubs get to raise their budgets was a good step), or nurturing WC players through the academy to have them pay for WC replacements (what Lyon was supposed to do once the stadium was paid for).",1,unfortun help think unavoid risk psg look sign establish wc player rather make bet youngster ligu attract leagu necessari overpay attract talent wage market convinc anoth probabl paid unless better want leav first place contract therefor sport director even critic psg real solut imho make ligu attract increas revenu attract neymar bump tv rais budget good step nurtur wc player academi wc replac lyon suppos stadium paid

[OC] 'Gracias Johan' - The Ajax &amp; Barcelona connection,"# Gracias Johan

During the 2018/19 Champions League campaign [two Barcelona fans on twitter produced one of the cringiest conversations ever](https://i.redd.it/173h5sfy0k031.jpg), saying: If Ajax and Barcelona would meet in the CL final fans would pull out banners saying 'Gracias Johan' in Catalan and Dutch and that Ajax and Barca fans would hold arms and jump together with the trophy. Both teams blew their lead in the semi-finals and the Ajax-Barca final didn't happen. 

The cringe aside, there is an undeniable connection between Ajax and Barcelona. [Sergino Dest](https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona/status/1311645807574216706) was announced at Barcelona this morning and became the 28th player to play for both Ajax and Barcelona.

# The 1970s: Michels, Cruyff and Neeskens

Rinus Michels became the Ajax manager in 1965, when they were fighting against relegation. He transformed that team into one of the strongest ever club sides as he laid the foundation for the team that would win three consecutive European Cups (1971-1973). Johan Cruyff was the star player of that team and Johan Neeskens the engine in the midfield. Rinus Michels' work was noticed by Barcelona and they hired them in 1971 as their manager, which started the Ajax - Barcelona connection. When Johan Cruyff wanted to leave Ajax in 1973, Michels and Barcelona saw their chance and signed him for a world record fee. Their first season was a success as Barcelona won La Liga for the first time in 14 years. Rinus Michels then managed the Netherlands during the 1974 World Cup, where they famously finished in second place with Total Football. After that World Cup, Johan Neeskens made the move from Ajax to Barcelona as well. Barcelona (with Michels, Cruyff and Neeskens) started to play a bit more in the style of Total Football as well, but it didn't result in many trophies: a 1978 Copa del Rey and (after Michels and Cruyff) already left a European Cup Winners' Cup in 1979.

# 1988-1996: Johan Cruyff as Barcelona manager

Johan Cruyff ended his career as a player in 1984 and became the Ajax manager in 1985. He won two domestic cups and a European Cup Winners' Cup before he left Ajax in January 1988. He became the Barcelona manager from the 1988/89 season onwards and took two Ajax youth players with him (Danny Muller and his own son Jordi Cruyff). Johan Cruyff implemented the style of play that he was used to, the 4-3-3 (or sometimes 3-4-3) and put more focus on the academy. In 1989 he signed Ronald Koeman from PSV (they had worked together at Ajax in 1985/86), mainly for his abilities on the ball as a central defender. He also signed Richard Witschge from Ajax in 1991. Cruyff had great success at Barcelona as  his 'Dream Team' won four consecutive La Liga titles (1991-1994) and he lead the club to their first European Cup: with Ronald Koeman famously scoring the winner at Wembley against Sampdoria in 1992. After a period of less success, Johan Cruyff was fired by the Barcelona board in the summer of 1996.

# Louis van Gaal &amp; the overkill of Dutch players

Louis van Gaal was the manager of Ajax during their second golden era (1991-97), winning the UEFA Cup, the Champions League, the Club World Cup and three Eredivisie titles. These impressive results helped Van Gaal to land the Barcelona job in the summer of 1997. Van Gaal planned to play at Barcelona with roughly the same philosophy as he did at Ajax. To achieve this he signed a lot of players that he had succes with at Ajax: Reiziger from Milan in 1997, Bogarde and Kluivert from Milan in 1998, Litmanen and Frank &amp; Ronald de Boer from Ajax in 1999 as well as some other Dutch players (Hesp, Zenden and Cocu). Van Gaal had some won La Liga during his first two seasons, but he clashed with the media and some players.  After failing to win La Liga during his third season he left in 2000 saying the famous words  ""*Amigos de la prensa. Yo me voy. Felicidades*."" (Friends of the press. I am leaving. Congratulations) during his final press conference. Louis van Gaal returned in 2002, but this time he only lasted for half a season as he was fired in January when Barcelona was in 12th place. 

Also during this time Michael Laudrup became the first player to play for Ajax after playing for Barcelona before. He played for Barcelona under Cruyff between 1989 and 1994 and played the final season of his career at Ajax in 1997/98.

# Cruyff's advice: Frank Rijkaard

Barcelona had a horrible 2002/03 season (finishing in 6th place) and where in not in a good place. Johan Cruyff advised the Barcelona board to appoint Frank Rijkaard as their new manager. Frank Rijkaard and Cruyff were teammats at Ajax for two seasons, and Cruyff was his manager at Ajax for two seasons. Rijkaard was a risky choice at the time however: he lead the Dutch NT to the semi-final at the 2000 Euros, but also relegated from the Eredivisie with Sparta for the first time in the history of the club. The Barcelona board trusted Cruyff and the decision worked out fine: Barca finished second in Rijkaard's first season, but then won La Liga in 2004/05 &amp; 2005/06 as well as the Champions League in 2005/06. Rijkaard's assistant Henk ten Cate left in the summer of 2006 to become the head coach of Ajax. Barcelona's results were getting worse and Rijkaard was fired in the summer of 2008 as he was replaced by Guardiola in 2008, another Cruyff disciple.

# The new era: Ronald Koeman

Ronald Koeman became the fifth Dutch manager (all with an Ajax history) to coach Barcelona. Frenkie de Jong was already at the club and with Dest he signed yet another former Ajax player. We'll have to wait and see how that all works out.

,,"Having watched nearly every Benfica Liga NOS game from the 19/20 season, I set out to write a little ""article"" that showcased Vin√≠cius's strenghts and weaknesses. With the help of some SmarterScout metrics, I tried to visually represent what the striker is good at and what he is not great at.

He is definitely not a Harry Kane type of player, and is suited to pair up with the englishman upfront in some games, maybe against weaker opposition. Defensively he is not great, but he fits Mourinho's scheme of not pressing at every single moment - since he may lack in intensity and match fitness.

He'll score goals as long as he has someone to provide him with good balls such as Lo Celso from a central area or Reguillon from crosses.

After being bought one year ago and taking Liga NOS by storm, Vin√≠cius no longer fits Benfica's new manager tactical system and I hope he can find the net multiple times (even off the bench) for the sake of portuguese football!

Hope you liked it, and feedback is appreciated.

And honestly, there's absolutely no reason to jump around with arms right out like that.  If you're arguing defenders should be allowed to do that, then every defender is going to stick their arms out at every header to try block the shot/cross.  

Keep it on the defender's responsibility to control their arms.

UEFA Europa League Playoff Round Preview,"The last step in the quest for the Group Stages ends today as 42 teams battle it out for the last few spots in the Playoff Round of the Europa League.

The playoff round will see teams divided into two paths. The Champions Path consists of 2 of the 10 losers of the¬†2020‚Äì21 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round Champions Path¬†(KF Tirana and Ludogorets Razgrad), 5 losers of the¬†2020‚Äì21 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round (Champions Path), and 9 winners of the third qualifying round Champions Path. The Main Path consists of 26 winners of the third qualifying round (Main Path).

On to today's action and here are several matches to keep an eye out for today:

PSV Eindhoven are one last step away from the Group Stage as they head to Norway to face Rosenborg, who will be hoping to keep the Norwegian flag flying high as they look to join Molde in the Group Stage.

Scottish sides Celtic and Rangers will be hoping to book their spots in the Group Stage, with Celtic heading to Bosnia to face FK Sarajevo while Rangers host Galatasaray in what should be a close match hopefully. 

The big story for today concerns Faroese side Klaksvik, the first side from the island to enter the playoff stages and will be hoping to go one step further, but they will first have to face Dundalk in Ireland to have a chance of making great history and one of the biggest upsets in competition history.

In the other matches to take note, AC Milan will next travel to Portugal to face Rio Ave while Tottenham Hotspur entertain Maccabi Haifa at home, just two days after their penalty shootout victory against Chelsea in the League Cup.

Ties to be played:

CFR Cluj (ROU) vs KuPS (FIN)

Ararat Armenia (ARM) vs Red Star Belgrade (SRB)

Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) vs Flora Tallinn (EST)

Malmoe FF (SWE) vs Granada (ESP)

"Pre-Match thread, Liverpool vs Arsenal, 01/10/2020: KO 19:45"," Pre-Match thread, Liverpool vs Arsenal

EFL Cup

Venue: Anfield

**Where** **to watch:** [https://m.livesoccertv.com/match/3790801/liverpool-vs-arsenal/](https://m.livesoccertv.com/match/3790801/liverpool-vs-arsenal/)

**Team news:**

* Virgil van Dijk was the only player to keep his place for the previous round against Lincoln City, and he was taken off at half time in that match when victory was already all but assured.
* With Joe Gomez now fit, he may be the centre-back kept on this time around with Klopp keen to keep his star men fresh, while Sepp van den Berg will be hoping for a chance alongside him after missing out to Rhys Williams against Lincoln.
* Kostas Tsimikas is set to replace Andrew Robertson on the left, while Adrian will take the gloves from Alisson Becker after the Brazilian passed a late fitness test to feature on Monday.
* Thiago Alcantara failed a fitness test of his own ahead of that game and is now not expected back until after the international break, but fellow summer signing Diogo Jota is available after opening his account to wrap up the points for Liverpool on Monday. He is also reported to have Covid which rules him out.
* Thursday's contest is likely to come too soon for Jordan Henderson to return, though, while Joel Matip and former Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also sidelined.
* Shkodran Mustafi continues to step up his recovery from a hamstring injury and should return to training later in October, although he will likely be unavailable until the very end of the month.
* Pablo Mari has been sidelined since June but is closing in on a return and could be back training ahead of this match. It is unlikely that the centre-back will be in contention for a competitive outing until after the international break, though.
* Emile Smith Rowe is still recovering from a shoulder injury he sustained in pre-season, but he is now out of his sling and a return is within sight, even if Thursday's match comes too soon.
* Gabriel Martinelli is not expected back in competitive action this calendar year after undergoing knee surgery in the summer.
* Calum Chambers is aiming to return to training in October, having been sidelined for the whole of 2020 so far with a serious knee injury he sustained just before the turn of the year.
* Cedric Soares was once again absent from the matchday squad against Liverpool due to an ongoing calf injury, although his omission is thought to be precautionary and he could be in contention to return here.
* Sokratis Papastathopoulos also missed out for the last trip to Anfield but, like Cedric, is close to recovering from his calf issue and could feature on Thursday.

**Form guide +/-**

Liverpool: 9/4 WWW

Arsenal: 6/4 WWL

**Match build up**

* Arsenal have undoubtedly made progress and appear to be on the right path under Mikel Arteta, but Monday's trip to Anfield was a reality check of sorts as Liverpool dominated throughout.
* Jurgen Klopp's men boasted 66% possession and had 21 shots, taking their overall tally for their three Premier League games so far to 61 efforts at goal - at least 17 more than any other side.
* Arteta himself admitted that Liverpool are still ""superior in many aspects"", yet there were also plenty of positives for the Gunners to take; they caught Liverpool's back line out on a couple of occasions during rare forays forward and, on another day, may have pinched a point from the game.
* There was no doubt that the hosts were deserved winners, though, and the performance was another imperious statement of intent from the champions as they maintained their 100% start to the season.
* A similarly dominant display against Chelsea the weekend before also helped to make a mockery of some of the pre-season predictions which tipped Manchester City as comfortable favourites to regain the Premier League crown.
* Klopp has developed Liverpool into a winning machine, and that is particularly true at home where they have now won 16 of their last 18 outings across all competitions.
* Anfield certainly seems to be the place to go for entertainment too, with Liverpool's last three home games having seen 19 goals fly in at either end - 12 of them scored by the hosts.
* Nothing has been quite as high-scoring as the 5-5 classic these two sides played out when they met on Merseyside at the same stage of this competition last season, almost exactly a year ago to the day.
* That 10-goal bonanza was eventually decided on penalties as Liverpool progressed, only to be knocked out in the next round while fielding their youth team against Aston Villa.
* The Reds were in free-scoring form in the third round this season too, though, putting Lincoln City to the sword with a merciless 7-2 drubbing at the LNER Stadium last week.
* Arsenal have been on the wrong end of plenty of Liverpool thumpings themselves in recent years but, while they were smothered by the Reds' pressing game for long spells on Monday night, they will take heart from the fact that they stayed in the game until the closing stages.
* Indeed, the Gunners have every reason to be confident of a different result against what is sure to be a much-changed Liverpool side on Thursday, having beaten the Reds twice in the last two months too.
* Liverpool may point to the fact that neither last season's Premier League meeting nor the Community Shield were high up their priority list, but they added to Arteta's impressive and growing collection of big scalps he has already claimed as manager nonetheless.
* The Spaniard looks well set to fare better in these games against fellow 'big six' opponents than Arsenal have done in the past, having already beaten Liverpool (twice), Manchester City and Chelsea since taking over.
* There is still work to be done when it comes to making the team more resilient, though, with Arsenal having dropped 18 points from winning positions under Arteta - more than any other Premier League side in that time period.
* Crucially, Arteta already has two trophies in his cabinet and success in the EFL Cup this season would complete a clean sweep of domestic cups as quickly as he could have possibly done so.
* Arsenal have not won this particular trophy since 1992-93, though, and have only lifted it twice in their entire history - the same number as Norwich City, Birmingham City and Wolverhampton Wanderers and fewer than Leicester City and Nottingham Forest.
* For a club of Arsenal's size, who have had unmatched success in the FA Cup and have regularly challenged for silverware in the Premier League era especially, that is a poor record and one which Arteta will be keen to improve.
* They got off to a good start in that respect in the third round with a 2-0 triumph at in-form Leicester, when Eddie Nketiah added to a Christian Fuchs own goal.
* Another victory on Thursday would send them through to the quarter-finals for the fourth time in the last five seasons, but as Arsenal have discovered more recently than anyone else, a trip to Anfield is the toughest assignment in English football at the moment.",,1,match thread liverpool vs arsen match thread liverpool vs arsen cup venu anfield watch http livesoccertv match liverpool vs arsen http livesoccertv match liverpool vs arsen team news virgil dijk player keep place previou lincoln citi taken half match victori alreadi assur joe gomez may centr kept around klopp keen keep fresh berg hope chanc alongsid miss rhi william lincoln kosta tsimika set replac andrew robertson left adrian take glove alisson becker brazilian pass featur monday thiago alcantara ahead game expect intern fellow summer sign diogo jota avail open account wrap point liverpool monday also report covid rule thursday contest like come soon jordan henderson return though joel matip former arsen midfield alex oxlad chamberlain also sidelin shkodran mustafi continu step recoveri hamstr injuri return train later octob although like unavail month pablo sidelin sinc june close return could train ahead match unlik centr content competit outing intern though emil row still recov shoulder injuri sustain season sling return within sight even thursday match come soon gabriel martinelli expect competit calendar year undergo knee surgeri summer calum chamber aim return train octob sidelin whole seriou knee injuri sustain year cedric soar absent matchday squad liverpool due ongo calf injuri although omiss thought precautionari could content return sokrati papastathopoulo also miss anfield like cedric close recov calf issu could featur thursday form guid liverpool arsen wwl match build arsen undoubtedli made progress appear path mikel arteta monday anfield realiti check sort liverpool domin throughout jurgen klopp boast possess take overal talli premier leagu game effort goal least side arteta admit liverpool still superior mani aspect yet also plenti gunner take caught liverpool coupl occas rare foray forward anoth day may pinch point game doubt deserv winner though perform anoth imperi statement intent champion maintain start season similarli domin display chelsea weekend also help make mockeri season predict tip manchest citi comfort favourit regain premier leagu crown klopp develop liverpool machin particularli true home outing across competit anfield certainli seem place entertain liverpool home game seen goal either score noth quit high score classic side merseysid competit season almost exactli year day goal bonanza eventu decid penalti liverpool progress next field youth team aston villa score form season though put lincoln citi sword merciless drub lner stadium week arsen wrong plenti liverpool thump recent year smother press game spell monday night take heart fact stay game close inde gunner everi reason confid differ result sure much chang liverpool side thursday beaten twice month liverpool may point fact neither season premier leagu meet shield high prioriti arteta impress grow collect scalp alreadi claim manag nonetheless spaniard look well set better game fellow oppon arsen done alreadi beaten liverpool twice manchest citi chelsea sinc take still work done come make team resili though arsen drop point arteta premier leagu side crucial arteta alreadi trophi cabinet success cup season would complet clean sweep domest cup quickli could possibl done arsen particular trophi sinc though lift twice entir histori number norwich citi birmingham citi wolverhampton wander fewer leicest citi nottingham forest arsen size unmatch success cup regularli challeng silverwar premier leagu especi record arteta keen improv good start respect triumph form leicest eddi nketiah fuch goal anoth victori thursday would send quarter final fourth five season arsen discov recent anyon els anfield toughest assign english footbal moment

They agreed with the fee, told him it was happening since he already booked the flight and was expected here tonight. But at the last minute, they have a board council that decides that they will instead keep him until December but agree to the allegedly improved fee Lyon offered. That was improved specifically because they asked for more to let him leave immediately... 

From our point of view, it's a really dubious way of behaving.

"Andrea Pirlo's Juventus: ""A vision too ambitious"" ?"," 

Pirlo‚Äôs second game as the coach for Juventus showed all the flaws of his tactics. Most of these weaknesses got displayed in the first game too, but Fonseca‚Äôs Roma side expose these flaws in this game. Pirlo is still playing in his 3-4-1-2 formation, as we all expected. Pirlo‚Äôs ideas are too ambitious, and it‚Äôs clear that he needs to concentrate more on creating shape in his build-ups. Roma was the perfect team to uncover his mistakes by applying a 3-4-3 formation that concentrates on attacking through the flanks. This was the ideal way to pick apart Juventus on counters, because of Juventus‚Äô ridiculous high defensive line and the slow regrouping.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rp27iinfzaq51.png?width=316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db787c48a42c8442b0c5660c67a66f2c6c4488a5

Starting with the most noticeable flaw is the high defensive line. On the surface level, there is nothing wrong with using a high defensive line, but it‚Äôs very na√Øve using a high defensive line when you use two slow defenders that played most of their career in a low defensive line. This defence is too heavy and slow to be playing like this against these types of teams. I‚Äôm disappointed with the lack of adjustments in the defensive structure when playing these levels of sides like Roma. This is the finest example of Pirlo being overly ambitious with his ideas.¬†

The high defensive line is already bad enough with these defenders. Now, consider this defence regrouping into a 4-4-2 while being countered sounds like a recipe for disaster. This happened throughout most of the game, and Pirlo didn‚Äôt change this before receiving a red card. Another issue is how slow Cuadrado drops to the defence and how slow Danilo (he had an overall great performance) moves to the right back. This issue made Spinazzola and Mkhitaryan have all the space in the world to produce a lot of chances.

The last problem with this defence is Bonucci. I have been a defender of Bonucci for the longest time, but he makes no sense in this defence at all. Bonucci‚Äôs performances in both games were terrible. Pirlo needs to get him out of this defence if he plays like this. Bonucci is a defender that was an elite at covering for Chiellini. Bonucci isn‚Äôt competent enough to do this anymore, which causes him to be rather useless. I know Juventus fans have hated him for the longest time, and I see the issue with him.

&amp;#x200B;

[My favorite example on Juventus' issues. We can see how overly aggressive McKennie is in this situation. They also gets punished for playing with this high defensive line and Bonucci unable to do his job. They also are unable to regroup to a 4-4-2.](https://reddit.com/link/j2odle/video/3axtxoskzaq51/player)

Juventus‚Äô positives about Pirlo, like him using Kulusevski as the right midfielder without permitting him a lot of defensive duties, which I admire to watch. Another positive is how good Arthur was in his creative deeper-lying role, which features all of his strengths he showed at Barcelona in one role. Juventus fans should be truly excited with Arthur because he provides something entirely different compared to the other midfielders.¬†

Going back to the weaknesses. Pirlo should try to concentrate more on Allegri‚Äôs principles, which are shape, discipline and instincts. These principals are not apparent at Juventus, except for instincts. Juventus smashed Sampdoria on individual quality. They had tremendous issues with opening Roma‚Äôs lower bloke because most of Juventus‚Äô player on offence is playing freely, but with a lack of movement. This is the reason Juventus didn‚Äôt progressive ball forward and instead, they got stuck outside the box playing sideways without being direct.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

[ Some examples of Juventus struggling to create shape in the offence and them generally not being able to progressive the ball forward.](https://reddit.com/link/j2odle/video/5690qhbvzaq51/player)

Most of their midfielders lack discipline throughout both games. Two midfielders were certainly lacking discipline in McKennie and Rabiot. Both players got continually caught off position. McKennie is playing overly aggressive many times in the game. When he did this, he was leaving a vast area behind himself, which shows the lack of discipline. He was doing this way too much, and it wasn‚Äôt a successful way of playing.

&amp;#x200B;

[Where is the midfield](https://reddit.com/link/j2odle/video/nhgx6d9q0bq51/player)

All of this being said, I still think it‚Äôs way too early to determine anything. This rambling was just about his flaws throughout this game.

Exclusive interview with Sevilla director of football Monchi: 'I cannot believe Manchester United do not have a sporting director',,,1,exclus interview sevilla director footbal monchi cannot believ manchest unit sport director
,,"Neither can I, Monchi.",1,neither monchi
,,"‚ÄúWe are specialists in doing more with less,‚Äù says Monchi, which given his extraordinary success as a sporting director with Sevilla, means he has certainly earned the right to be listened to.

The 52-year-old has risen to be regarded as one of the best in the business ‚Äì and, naturally, he is perplexed why some big clubs, such as Manchester United, who Sevilla beat in the Europa League semi-final on their way to winning the trophy, do not employ specialists such as him.

‚ÄúThis is my opinion ‚Äì all clubs should have this position,‚Äù Monchi says. ‚ÄúWhat is the main function? To dedicate the time to everything that relates on a sports level. Where 60-70 per cent of the budget is allocated to the first team, if you don‚Äôt have a specialist who deals with that, it is very difficult to understand.

‚ÄúI do understand there are very successful clubs ‚Äì Manchester United are probably one of the top five in the world, but they do not have that specific position ‚Äì but I think that clubs more and more are aware that they really need this position and also we are the connection between the technical staff, the squad, the board, we know the ¬≠market, we get lots of information through the different scouts.

‚ÄúSo, for me, I can‚Äôt believe a club does not have this particular position. Logically, I have to believe in it because that‚Äôs what I do. But I do think it‚Äôs essential.‚Äù

Many United fans, given the club‚Äôs apparent struggles in the transfer market, will readily agree, although when Monchi was given the opportunity to work in the Premier League, he turned down an approach from Arsenal to return to rebuild Sevilla after he left Roma two years ago.

Still, there are some Premier League clubs whose work he admires, although he states that often it is the ‚Äúmoney that makes the difference‚Äù when it comes to the English market. ‚ÄúThere are clubs like Leeds, Liverpool and [Manchester] City, amongst ¬≠others, that are working with quite a well-developed sporting management structure.

‚ÄúIt is difficult for us to compete with English football, but we do so by making our brand name known, which is undoubtedly associated with success.

‚ÄúMaybe we can‚Äôt pay that much, but we can offer a very exclusive sporting challenge, I would say almost unique. There are the numbers‚Äâ‚Ä¶ 20 finals in this century, 10 titles, kings of the Europa League, we are specialists in doing more with less.‚Äù

Monchi ‚Äì whose full name is Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo ‚Äì is so passionate about what he does that he released 13, 13-minute episodes on Sevilla‚Äôs YouTube channel to explain his work. Thirteen was the number he wore as a reserve goalkeeper before retiring in 2000 to take up his role with Sevilla, who were facing a financial crisis and had just been relegated. Since then his record has been hugely impressive ‚Äì with the magic formula of coupling on-field success with recouping huge revenues through transfers.

Among those he has sold are Sergio Ramos, Jesus Navas and Jose Antonio Reyes, while recently Sevilla turned down an offer of more than ‚Ç¨50‚Äâmillion (¬£46‚Äâmillion) from City for Jules Kounde, more than double what they paid for the defender only last year.

‚ÄúIt is like a father who has lots of different children. When you say to a father ‚Äòwhich one do you like the best?‚Äô he says ‚ÄòI like them all in the same manner‚Äô,‚Äù Monchi says when asked to rank his best signings.

‚ÄúMaybe the player ‚Äì with the way we signed him up, the level of performance and what he gave the club on an economic level ‚Äì is Dani Alves [signed for ‚Ç¨200,000 and sold for ‚Ç¨36‚Äâmillion having won five trophies]. There are other names, like Fabiano, [Ivan] Rakitic, [Ever] Banega. I could spend the whole interview talking about all these important players.‚Äù

One who left Sevilla this summer ‚Äì albeit after the end of a loan deal from Real Madrid ‚Äì and has since joined Tottenham Hotspur for ‚Ç¨30‚Äâmillion, is left-back Sergio Reguilon. ‚ÄúHe is a great player,‚Äù Monchi says. ‚ÄúLast year he was a very, very important footballer. I believe that he grew a lot with us, because until he arrived at Sevilla he had not enjoyed continuity at an elite level. I don‚Äôt know what will happen in England, because it is another footballing context, but he has everything to succeed.‚Äù

Until Monchi arrived, Sevilla, who narrowly lost last week‚Äôs Uefa Super Cup to Bayern Munich after extra time, had won just four trophies in their 52-year history. Since then, there have been 10 ‚Äì including winning the Europa League an incredible six times and all this while players have continually been bought and sold. Monchi describes how he works.

‚ÄúWe have two pillars. One is scouting and the other is the co-ordination with the coach. At Sevilla, the coach does not decide the name of the player. He says the profile of the player he would like and we work on that.‚Äù

The year is divided in two ‚Äì starting with July to December. ‚ÄúThe first part is what we call the ‚Äògross tracking‚Äô, where we do a very broad tracking of all the tournaments and championships that we think are important, so that we get as many players as possible into our database.‚Äù Each of Sevilla‚Äôs 12 scouts is assigned certain leagues ‚Äì for example ‚Äúthe Premier League and the Belgian league and the one for Ukraine‚Äù ‚Äì and each month they identify 11 ‚Äúideal‚Äù players.

‚ÄúIn December, we open up our database and go through all the different information we have been accumulating as we start on the second part of our year. We move from ‚Äògross‚Äô to ‚Äònet‚Äô tracking and we don‚Äôt follow matches in general. We have around 400 to 450 players and six or seven technical staff carry out a tracking of them. From January we follow that up and by May we have another selection, another screening.

‚ÄúIt is still 15 players per position, so around 150-160 players, and we sit down with the coach and say ‚ÄòMister, what do you think we need for this year?‚Äô And then maybe we have those 15 players who play that position and we ask ‚Äòwhich ones fill all the characteristics that the coach wants?‚Äô Then we get down to seven finalists and they are the names we give to the coach.

‚ÄúThey have been through lots of different filters and if the coach likes one of the names then we start to move into the next phase of seeing whether we can sign him up. We have assessed the players by ‚ÄòA, B, C, D, E‚Äô and A is obviously a player that will be at a top, top level. And then it goes down in category. I get all this information.‚Äù

There is a pause. ‚ÄúWhen I started in 2000, the structure of the sports management side was almost zero, we started from scratch. Today we are a club that people want to study and see how we work. We don‚Äôt stop. And information ‚Äì that is the secret behind everything.‚Äù",1,specialist say monchi given extraordinari success sport director sevilla mean certainli earn listen year risen regard busi natur perplex manchest unit sevilla europa leagu semi final trophi employ specialist opinion monchi say function dedic everyth relat sport level cent budget alloc first team specialist deal difficult understand understand success manchest unit probabl top five world specif think awar realli need also connect technic staff squad board know market inform differ scout believ particular logic believ think essenti mani unit given appar struggl transfer market readili agre although monchi given opportun work premier leagu approach arsen return rebuild sevilla left roma year still premier leagu whose work admir although state often make differ come english market like leed liverpool manchest citi amongst work quit well develop sport manag structur difficult compet english footbal make brand known undoubtedli associ success mayb much offer exclus sport challeng would say almost uniqu number final centuri europa leagu specialist monchi whose ramon rodriguez verdejo passion releas minut episod sevilla youtub channel explain work thirteen number wore reserv goalkeep retir take role sevilla financi crisi releg sinc record huge impress formula coupl field success recoup huge revenu transfer among sold sergio ramo nava jose antonio rey recent sevilla offer million million citi jule kound doubl paid defend year like father differ say father like say like manner monchi say ask rank sign mayb player sign level perform gave econom level dani alv sign sold million five trophi like fabiano ivan rakit ever banega could spend whole interview talk import player left sevilla summer albeit loan deal real madrid sinc tottenham hotspur million left sergio reguilon great player monchi say year import footbal believ grew arriv sevilla enjoy continu elit level know england anoth footbal context everyth succeed monchi arriv sevilla narrowli lost week uefa super cup bayern munich extra trophi year histori sinc includ europa leagu incred player continu bought sold monchi describ work pillar scout ordin coach sevilla coach decid player say profil player would like work year divid start juli decemb first part broad tournament championship think import mani player possibl databas sevilla scout assign certain leagu exampl premier leagu belgian leagu ukrain month identifi ideal player decemb open databas differ inform accumul start second part year move follow match gener around player seven technic staff carri januari follow may anoth select anoth screen still player around player coach say mister think need year mayb player ask fill characterist coach want seven finalist coach differ filter coach like start move next phase see whether sign assess player obvious player top top level goe categori inform paus start structur sport manag side almost zero start scratch today peopl want studi see work stop inform secret behind everyth

**Match Events**

**1‚Äô**: Kick off

**17‚Äô**: **CLOSE!** Nice move from United. Ighalo rounds the keeper but can‚Äôt quite find his feet to tuck it away.

**26‚Äô**: A nice team move sees Jahanbakhsh strike at goal from 20 yards. Henderson saves down to his right.

**43‚Äô**: Burn is shown a yellow card. 

**43‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAAL!!** Fantastic free kick from Mata whose free kick picks out McTominay at the back post. He has the simplest of tasks in nodding home from 6 yards.](https://streamja.com/jnQe7)

**Halftime**: Don‚Äôt let the scoreline fool you, it‚Äôs been a drab affair so far. Surely the second half can only get better?

**50‚Äô**: Maupay comes on to replace Jahanbakhsh.

**67‚Äô**: **CLOSE!** Henderson turns away Trossards close range shot. Great save. Pogba and Rashford then replace Ighalo and James.

**72‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAAL!** Van de Beek‚Äôs cute back heel plays Mata in. He twists and dummies to give himself a yard before placing it through the defenders legs and in to the bottom corner. Great composure from Mata.](https://streamja.com/vVQqM)

**79‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAL** Pogba‚Äôs deflected free kick goes in to the top corner. It may have been going wide before a deflection from Veltman.](https://streamja.com/B4w33)

He maintained his level in different teams and in the national team. He is 35 and has won everything everywhere. Against Roma he ran everywhere, didn't lose and wanted to score. When Ronaldo sets a goal, he gets there. He knows him well and I am convinced that in addition to winning the championship he also wants to be the best scorer, something he has not yet achieved. Obviously he wants the Champions. He is very happy. If he was not well in the team, then he would not have the performances he has had and goals like that against Roma.

UEFA Champions League Playoff Round Second Leg Review,"The Champions League Playoff Round Second Leg took place over the past two days as the qualifying stages have reached their conclusion.

It was easy wins for both Salzburg and Dynamo Kyiv as they booked their spots in the Group Stages courtesy of home wins against Gent and Maccabi Tel Aviv respectively. 

Ferencvaros managed to go into the group stages after the away goals rule helped them, following a stalemate at the Groupama Arena. Olympiakos dominated their game but couldn't extend their aggregate lead further against Omonia Nicosia, ending in a stalemate, but their first leg performance enough to see them through to the group stage.

There was cause for celebrations in Denmark after FC Midtjylland won 4-1 in the second leg after a first leg stalemate, this will be their first time in the Group Stages of the Champions League. And there was no such problems for FC Krasnodar, a 2-1 win away at PAOK enough to see them through.

Full results:

Dynamo Kyiv 3-0 Gent (Dynamo Kyiv win 5-1 on aggregate)

Ferencvaros 0-0 Molde (3-3 on aggregate, Ferencvaros win on away goals rule)

Omonia Nicosia 0-0 Olympiakos (Olympiakos win 2-0 on aggregate)

FC Midtjylland 4-1 Slavia Prague (FC Midtjylland win 4-1 on aggregate)

PAOK Thessaloniki 1-2 FC Krasnodar (FC Krasnodar win 4-2 on aggregate)

Salzburg 3-1 Maccabi Tel Aviv (Salzburg win 5-2 on aggregate)

&amp;#x200B;

With the Qualifying rounds now complete, here is the full list of 32 teams that will be competing in the Group Stages, sorted by the pots that they are in.

Pot 1: Bayern Munich (Title Holders), Sevilla (Europa League Winners), Real Madrid, Liverpool, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Zenit St. Petersburg and Porto

Pot 2: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, Manchester United, Shakhtar Donetsk, Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and Ajax

Pot 3: Dynamo Kyiv, RB Salzburg, RB Leipzig, Inter Milan, Olympiakos, Lazio, FC Krasnodar and Atalanta

Pot 4: Lokomotiv Moscow, Marseille, Club Brugge, Borussia Monchengladbach, Istanbul Basaksehir, FC Midtjylland, Rennes and Ferencvaros

&amp;#x200B;

Who do you think will be in the same group? The draw for the Champions League will be at 5pm CEST.

,,"Arguably, Pot 2 is stronger than Pot 1, and that‚Äôs due to two slots being reserved in Pot 1 for EL/CL winners, which leads to:

A) One of the national League winning teams also winning the CL, leading to an additional spot for Portuguese/Russian team in Pot 1 (in 4 previous years, the CL winner spot was Real or Liverpool, both non-title winners, so this year with Bayern that‚Äôs an exception)

B) The EL winner, which lands up going to a non Top4 team from one of the Top3 leagues (Seville, Chelsea, Man Utd, Athletico), inherently making Pot 1 weaker.

Objectively, I don‚Äôt think Portuguese or Russian league winners are more deserving to be in Pot 1 than the 2nd place team in Spain, England, the two country‚Äôs UEFA coefficient is significantly higher than the others iirc. 

In the future event of CL winner also being a national league winner, the additional slot should go to 2nd place team of highest UEFA coefficient (say, Spain), rather than Portuguese/Russian teams. And the 2nd issue is easily solved by giving EL winner a spot in Pot 2.

As it stands, Pot 2 teams are objectively better placed for a ‚Äòsweetheart‚Äô draw. 

Why is this a big deal? Because not only is it against the spirit of the seedings, but also will lead to 1-2 ‚Äògroups of death‚Äô with 3 strong teams, where a team finishing 3rd, will drop into EL, being genuinely stronger than the EL competition, and thereby diluting the EL winners worth as a ‚Äòpromotion‚Äô opportunity.

Frankly, as Jose said at some point in the past, 3rd place CL group stage teams parachuting into the EL is bullshit anyways.",1,arguabl stronger due slot reserv winner lead leagu team also lead addit portugues russian team previou year winner real liverpool winner year bayern except winner land top team top leagu sevil chelsea utd athletico inher make weaker object think portugues russian leagu winner deserv place team spain england countri uefa coeffici significantli higher iirc futur event winner also leagu winner addit slot place team highest uefa coeffici say spain rather portugues russian team issu easili solv winner stand team object better place sweetheart draw deal spirit seed also lead group strong team team finish drop genuin stronger competit therebi dilut winner worth promot opportun frankli jose said point place group team parachut anyway

He had a few very good months where Grego and Finnbo were banging them in every game, afterwards and even before that his tactics were way too complicated for the team and over the top. That stuff may work on a whiteboard but not on the field, he notoriously ignored his players pleas. Whenever he decided to play a simpler and more defensive style, it miraculously worked way better.

On top of that, he is not a players coach from what I've read during his stint in Augsburg. What Hinti said and did may have been unprofessional, but I still think that he was right and he wasnt the only one thinking that Baum lost it.

Maybe he'll find success with a better squad now, who knows.

How long is Son out? He has to make a u turn on Deli as Lucas form hasnt been up to scratch and jose playing him in a 2 with son last year really slowed his game.

,,"Relevant part of the article:

Mourinho handed the powers that be at Tottenham a very clear picture of what Tottenham look like without a striker on Tuesday night.

Unwilling to risk Harry Kane as a starter with more big games to come and with Son Heung-min out injured until after the international break, it was left to Lamela and Steven Bergwijn to carry the load, taking turns as a duo in taking on the most advanced role.

Spurs muddled through without that penetration in the final third and it was only when Kane came off the bench that they were able to break the deadlock as he created problems as a focal point.

The striker issue has long been a problem for Tottenham, mostly due to Kane's presence, across what is now three transfer windows, and Mourinho has been growing increasingly frustrated about the lack of movement.

However, football.london understands that Spurs are finally closing in on agreeing a deal for a new forward more than 14 months after Fernando Llorente left the club.

The club are hopeful of tying up the deal ahead of Monday's transfer deadline day.

Talks are still at a delicate stage but Spurs had narrowed down their striker search in recent weeks to a number of players competing across Europe's leagues.

Tottenham have made enquiries about Torino captain Andrea Belotti, Metz striker Habib Diallo and Benfica duo Carlos Vin√≠cius and Haris Seferovic.

The club also retain an interest in Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik and football.london understands that while the Poland international, who has suffered some big knee injuries in recent years, is not currently the club's main choice, he remains an option after being offered to a number of teams in the Premier League after his move to Roma collapsed.",1,relev part articl mourinho power tottenham clear pictur tottenham look like without striker tuesday night unwil risk harri kane starter game come heung injur intern left lamela steven bergwijn carri take duo take advanc role spur muddl without final kane bench deadlock creat problem focal point striker issu problem tottenham mostli due kane presenc across transfer window mourinho grow increasingli frustrat movement howev footbal london understand spur final close agre deal new forward month fernando llorent left hope deal ahead monday transfer deadlin day talk still delic spur narrow striker search recent week number player compet across leagu tottenham made enquiri torino captain andrea belotti metz striker habib diallo benfica duo carlo vin ciu hari seferov also retain interest napoli striker arkadiusz milik footbal london understand poland intern suffer knee injuri recent year current choic option offer number team premier leagu move roma collaps

Step 1: Sign Dembele (famously injury prone and has stated he wants to succeed at Barcelona) 

Step 2: Loads of media &amp; PR with Martial &amp; Pogba.

Step 3: Watch on as Dembele stays injured or unmotivated on massive wages at a club he doesn‚Äôt want to play for.

,,Were are all the people who said that atletico was gonna take the league now? I'm tired of sports journalists and fans overreacting when specially in this case they stomped a Granada who didn't care a bit about that game and were focused Europa. Now it's Barcelona's turn to show that they are also still a team with problems once they face a team that actually tries unlike Villareal team who were holding for today (and won 3-1).,1,peopl said atletico gonna take leagu tire sport journalist overreact special case stomp granada care game focus europa barcelona also still team problem team actual unlik villar team hold today

In this series I will present each of the 12 Brazilian teams that together compose the [""Big 12""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Twelve_%28Brazilian_football%29). My point is to make them more knowledgeable to you, since each one of these teams have their share of the Brazil national team success and of Brazilian club football accomplishments as a whole. I'll try to be as smooth, efficient and non-boring as I can. If the feedback is positive, I'll keep bringing more to this series. So ok, let's do this!

**Method:** I'll present the teams in a chronological order, from the oldest foundation (Flamengo-1895) to the latest one (S√£o Paulo-1930). The order will be: Flamengo, Vasco, Fluminense, Gr√™mio, Botafogo, Atl√©tico Mineiro, Internacional, Corinthians, Santos, Palmeiras, Cruzeiro, S√£o Paulo. How many of these have you heard of?

**Extra clubs:** Due to a high number of requests, I'll also present 3 teams who don't belong to the Big12, but are also considered big clubs in Brazil: **Bahia**, **Athletico Paranaense** and **Coritiba**. Welcome to the club!

**Geographical reference:** Before we start, I'd like to ask something very simple from you. I want you to keep in mind that these 12 teams are spread in 4 different States in Brazil. The club's State name is written below, next to the club's name. It has a direct link to Google Maps, so that you can check it out to make this experience more accurate.

**Palestra Italia and the first decades**

Inspired by the Italian team founded in S√£o Paulo in 1914, *Palestra Italia* (eventually Palmeiras), the Belo Horizonte Italian city colony decided to create their own Palestra Italia in 1921. In 1925 already, the club was open to any nationality.

Until 1959, due to Brazil's huge size and weak infrastructure, there wasn't a national league yet, so the teams played inside their own State Leagues. Cruzeiro won their first in 1928, followed by two more titles in 1929 and 1930. At that point, their rivals [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro) and [Am√©rica Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9rica_Futebol_Clube_%28MG%29) had 3 and 10 titles, respectivally.

In 1931, two Cruzeiro's players became the firsts Brazilians bought by an European club: *Nin√£o* (FW) and *Nininho* (LB) left for [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio) in 1931.

**1942: World War II, Palestra Italia becomes Cruzeiro**

After Brazil's war declaration against the Axis, every Italian/German/Nippon-associated name in the country would have to be rebranded. *Palestra Italia* became *Palestra Mineiro* (*Mineiro* meaning ""from the state of Minas Gerais""). However, despite *Palestra* being a greek word, it had to be taken out aswell. Yale, Ypiranga and Cruzeiro were suggested at the assembly, with the latter being chosen, in honor of the *Cruzeiro do Sul* constellation.

Through the 1940s, 1950s and until 1965, Cruzeiro won 8 more State League titles, totalizing 11 titles, [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro) and [Am√©rica Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9rica_Futebol_Clube_%28MG%29) had 22 and 12 titles, respectivally.

**1965-1977: the dream team**

In this period, Cruzeiro stepped up from being a regional team to become a major national protagonist, notably beating the big teams from the Rio-S√£o Paulo axis.

Cruzeiro won 1 Copa Libertadores (1976), 1 Brazilian League (1966) and 10 State Leagues (5 of them consecutively). They also finished 2nd in 3 Brazilian Leagues (1969, 1974, 1975) and 1 Copa Libertadores (1977). 

Cruzeiro also provided 7 World Cup call-ups, with [Tost√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Gon%C3%A7alves_de_Andrade) (1966, 1970), [Fontana](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_de_Anchieta_Fontana) (1970), [Piazza](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_da_Silva_Piazza) (1970, 1974) and [Nelinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Resende_de_Matos_Cabral) (1974, 1978). Besides, from 1970 to 1975, 6 Cruzeiro players' were elected to one of the greatest League XI in the world at that time: [Brito](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9rcules_Brito_Ruas) (1970), [Dirceu Lopes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirceu_Lopes_Mendes) (1970, 1971, 1973), [Tost√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Gon%C3%A7alves_de_Andrade) (1970), [Piazza](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_da_Silva_Piazza) (1972), [Nelinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Resende_de_Matos_Cabral) (1975) and [Palhinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderley_Eust%C3%A1quio_de_Oliveira) (1975). [Tost√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Gon%C3%A7alves_de_Andrade) was **elected 1971 South American Player of the Year.**

**Everything started in 1965**: the team wasn't performing well in the State League, until the building of the new city stadium ended - the *Mineir√£o* inspired Cruzeiro to become a more competitive team, so that they ended the State League as undisputed champions.

In 1966, the team was reinforced with some talents, for the 8th edition of the Brazilian League, still disputed in a short knock-out system. Only each State League champion of all the Brazilian states (21) were allowed into it, as well as the current champions. Cruzeiro had never gone beyond a top6 position, but in 1966 everything would be different.

**It was in that 1966 season that Cruzeiro beat Pel√©'s Santos 6-2 in the final, at a full Mineir√£o (90.000 spectators)**. It was absurd, and no one could believe that.

Santos had 6 World Cup champions on their line-up, and had won 5 consecutive Brazilian League titles, besides being continental and club world champions twice, and having smashed every possible big team in the world. But now, it was Cruzeiro who smashed them 6-2, **with a hat-trick from Dirceu Lopes**.

The first half ended 5-0 in Cruzeiro's favor, with a constant bombing from them. Santos scored twice in the second half, before Cruzeiro ended the match with their 6th goal: you can see [all Cruzeiro goals here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmHvVFoiLB4).

**In the final 2nd leg**, the rain transformed the pitch into a mud. Santos ended the first half with a 2-0 advantage, with Pel√© scoring once - things seemed to have come back to normal. But they only seemed, as Cruzeiro score three times in the second half, at '63, '73 and '89, besides missing a penalty at '57. First [with Tost√£o from this nice free-kick](https://youtu.be/m5SDOKywnwE?t=130), then with [Dirceu Lopes and Natal](https://youtu.be/m5SDOKywnwE?t=141). It was over, Cruzeiro **had beaten Pel√©'s Santos and were crowned Brazilian League champions for the first time**. **Highlights** to goalkeeper [Raul](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Plassmann), who operated miracles throughout the second match and to defensive midfielder [Piazza](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Piazza), who made Pel√© disappear on the pitch.

This victory meant a lot in the development of Brazil's National League: the [1967 Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1967_%28Torneio_Roberto_Gomes_Pedrosa%29#Participantes) (interstate league) was then opened and enlarged to teams from the states of Minas Gerais (Cruzeiro, Atl√©tico Mineiro) and Rio Grande do Sul (Gr√™mio, Internacional), as a recognition of their level, thus creating a new Brazilian League, more condensed and elitized, gathering the best teams from 4 states, rather than the old democratic (but less competitive) format which gathered 21 states.

Cruzeito kept collecting State League titles against their archrival [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro): 5 in a row between 1965 and 1969, then 4 in a row between 1972 and 1975 - 9 titles in 12 years, Cruzeiro's best rate until today. **Highlights** to [Roberto Perfumo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Perfumo), prestigious Argentine center-back, elected to Argentina all-time dream team, who played in 138 matches for Cruzeiro between 1971-74.

In 1969, they finished second to [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras) in the Brazilian League, [due to just 1 fewer goal on the goal difference](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1969#Classifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o_do_quadrangular_final) (1x2). 

In 1974, they finished second to [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Vasco_da_Gama) in the Brazilian League. They had a greater goal difference (2x1) but the rule determined an extra match, which [Cruzeiro lost 1-2](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1974#Fase_final). 

**1976: the first Copa Libertadores title**

After losing the [1975 Brazilian League](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1975#Fase_final) final 0-1 to [Internacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Internacional), Cruzeiro picked the second spot to the [1976 Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Copa_Libertadores#Group_3_%28Brazil,_Paraguay%29).

Only 1 of 4 teams would advance from their group stage, shared with [Internacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Internacional), and the Paraguayans [Olimpia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Olimpia) and [Sportivo Luque√±o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportivo_Luque%C3%B1o). It was pretty much clear that the spot would go either to Cruzeiro or Internacional: they met on the first match, a [crazy 5-4 victory to Cruzeiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46RRhyAfSes), who was never behind in the score - they were leading 3-1, Internacional tied at '51, Cruzeiro took the lead again, but Internacional tied at '70, before Cruzeiro closed the coffin at '84 from a penalty kick.

In the second group stage, Cruzeiro demolished Ecuadorians and Peruvians with 4 easy wins: 3-1, 4-0, 7-1, 4-1. They qualified to the **big final** against [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate) with a 9W-1D campaign, scoring 38 goals in 10 matches.

**In the final 1st leg**, Cruzeiro demolished the Argentines, beating them 4-1 at home. In the second leg, however, they were beaten 1-2 at the Monumental stadium in Argentina, and the title would be decided in an extra match, in Chile.

**In the 3rd and decisive match**, [Cruzeiro had opened 2-0 at '55 with Nelinho and Eduardo](https://youtu.be/n6iF3eaqLJE?t=92), but [River Plate reacted and scored at '59 and '64](https://youtu.be/n6iF3eaqLJE?t=115). At '88, [Jo√£ozinho scored the title goal from a free-kick](https://youtu.be/n6iF3eaqLJE?t=128), and **Cruzeiro were declared South American champions for the first time**, the second Brazilian team to do so.

[Palhinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Eust%C3%A1quio_de_Oliveira) was the topscorer, with 13 goals in 11 matches. The South American level was so crazy back then, that no Cruzeiro player was included in the [South American POTY shortlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Footballer_of_the_Year), with the likes of [Figueroa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El%C3%ADas_Figueroa) (1st),  [Zico](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zico) (2nd) and [Rivellino](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rivellino) (3rd) making it.

This title qualified Cruzeiro to the [1976 Intercontinental Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Intercontinental_Cup) against European champions [Bayern M√ºnchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich). However, they lost the title over two legs - a 0-2 defeat in Germany and a 0-0 tie in Brazil.

**In 1977**, Cruzeiro entered the Copa Libertadores on the second stage, as current champions, where they beat [Internacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Internacional) and [Portuguesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguesa_F.C.). In the finals, [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) beat them 5-4 in the penalties on the third match (0-1, 1-0, 0-0).

**1990s: international glory, birth of Ronaldo Naz√°rio, and *Copa do Brasil* supremacy**

Cruzeiro vanished from the domestic and international scene in the 1980s, collecting just two state league titles in 1984 and 1987. 

The 1990s however marked the rebirth of the *Fox*. They won 6 international titles (1 Libertadores, 2 Supercopa Libertadores, 1 Recopa, 1 Copa Ouro, 1 Copa Master), 3 *Copa do Brasil*, and saw the uprising of Ronaldo Naz√°rio between 1993 and 1994.

**1991-92: back-to-back Supercopa Libertadores titles**

The [Supercopa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_Libertadores) (1988-97) gathered all the teams who had already conquered the prestigious Copa Libertadores, in a knock-out tournament, that would give a spot in the Recopa Sudamericana.

In 1991, Cruzeiro won it after 8 matches (2W-4D-2L), beating [Colo-Colo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colo-Colo) (Chile) (0-0, 0-0, p.k. 4-3), [Nacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Nacional_de_Football) (Uruguay) (4-0, 0-3), [Olimpia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Olimpia) (Paraguay) (1-1, 0-0, p.k. 5-4) and [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate) (Argentina) (0-2, 3-0) in the final.

**Highlights** to Cruzeiro comeback in the big final, [scoring 3 goals on the return leg at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MCNjW4YKbg) (6mn video), in front of 70.000 spectators. It was Cruzeiro's second international trophy, the second won against [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate).

In the 1992 title campaign, Cruzeiro beat [Atl√©tico Nacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl%C3%A9tico_Nacional) (Colombia) (1-1, 8-0), [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate) (Argentina) (2-0, 0-2, p.k. 5-4), [Olimpia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Olimpia) (Paraguay) (1-0, 2-2), and [Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Club_de_Avellaneda) (Argentina) (4-0, 0-1) in the final. 

The next year, Cruzeiro won their first *Copa do Brasil*, which had been launched in 1989. They beat [Nautico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_N%C3%A1utico_Capibaribe) (0-1, 2-0) with [this nice qualiyfing-goal after a nutmeg from Nonato](https://youtu.be/ojdCt48OwME?t=70). Then they beat the reserves of [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Futebol_Clube) in the quarter-finals, and [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_de_Regatas_Vasco_da_Gama) in the semis (3-1, 1-1). **The final** would be against [Gr√™mio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%AAmio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense), the Brazilian *Rei de Copas* (King of Cups). First leg away ended 0-0, and at home Cruzeiro won 2-1, [with the winning goal coming from a header at '65](https://youtu.be/O-9n2kdLYpI?t=147).

In those years, however, Cruzeiro lost two Recopa Sudamericana to the Libertadores champions [Colo-Colo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colo-Colo), in 1992, and [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC), in 1993.

**1993: Ronaldo Naz√°rio, the birth of a legend**

At the age of 16, [Ronaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldo_Naz%C3%A1rio) made his professional debut for Cruzeiro. In that 1993 season, Ronaldo played only 29 matches of the team's 62 over the year, and still managed to score 28 goals, being the topscorer. He notably scored 12 goals in 14 Brazilian League matches, and 8 goals (topscorer) in 4 Supercopa Libertadores' matches. In the Supercopa Libertadores, he scored a hat-trick and a brace against [Colo-Colo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colo-Colo) (Chile), a brace against [Nacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Nacional_de_Football) (Uruguay), before his team fell on penalties.

He also scored 5 goals on the same league match against [Bahia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_Bahia), notably [this funny/iconic one against the celebrated Uruguayan goalkeeper Rodolfo Rodriguez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THlbiaNUcOU). 

The next season, in 1994, Ronaldo kept destroying his adversaries, before leaving to [PSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven). He scored 28 in 29 matches, 22 of them in the state league (which Cruzeiro won undefeated), and a special historical one against [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) in the Copa Libertadores, where he performed [his traditional *arrancada*](https://youtu.be/zL8ZKQeYi9k?t=315), going from the midfield past 4 adversaries, including the goalkeeper, before scoring.

He was called and won the 1994 World Cup with Brazil, before leaving Cruzeiro, having scored 56 goals in 58 matches.

**1996-97: Cruzeiro's second Copa do Brasil and Copa Libertadores titles**

As complete underdogs, Cruzeiro won for the second time the *Copa do Brasil* and the prestigious Copa Libertadores.

**In 1996 Copa do Brasil**, Cruzeiro demolished [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_de_Regatas_Vasco_da_Gama) in the round of 16, [beating them 6-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss7Tk482v_Q) and then tying 1-1. In the quarter-finals, they [smashed the good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwv84cKmUm0) [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) of [Edmundo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_%28futebolista%29) and [Marcelinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelinho_Carioca) 4-0 and advanced to the semis, where they tied twice against [Flamengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo) (1-1, 0-0). **The big final** would be against the stellar team of [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras), of the monsters [Cafu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafu), [J√∫nior](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen%C3%ADlson_%C3%82ngelo_de_Souza), [Djalminha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djalminha), [Luiz√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Carlos_Bombonato_Goulart) and [Rivaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaldo). Cruzeiro had [Dida](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dida_%28futebolista%29), who [saved this shot at the end of the first leg](https://youtu.be/l3fA79syeNc?t=90), [Marcelo Ramos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Ramos), [who scored the tying goal](https://youtu.be/l3fA79syeNc?t=58) and the excellent/multichampion [Palhinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Ferreira_da_Silva). The 1-1 tie at home wasn't great, but Cruzeiro somehow managed to beat [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras) 2-1 away in the 2nd leg, in a great comeback.

[Palmeiras opened the score at '6 with this majestic Djalminha-to-Rivaldo-to-Luiz√£o goal](https://youtu.be/De4oNFB4WnY?t=19) - everyone was expecting a large win by Palmeiras. But Cruzeiro tied at '25 with [Roberto Gaucho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Ga%C3%BAcho), [after Amaral childish mistake](https://youtu.be/De4oNFB4WnY?t=41).

In the second half, **Dida appeared**. The goalkeeper [made several great defenses](https://youtu.be/De4oNFB4WnY?t=61), which prevented Cruzeiro from suffering a massacre. The excellent [Palhinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Ferreira_da_Silva) answered [with this touch of finesse, saved by Velloso](https://youtu.be/De4oNFB4WnY?t=80). At '85, [Marcelo Ramos scored the winning goal](https://youtu.be/De4oNFB4WnY?t=84) and **Cruzeiro were Copa do Brasil champions.**

This title qualified Cruzeiro to the [1997 Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Copa_Libertadores#Teams).

**1997: Copa Libertadores title, Cruzeiro are continental champions again**

After 21 years, Cruzeiro won the Copa Libertadores for the second time. Unlike their 1976 squad, the team had a difficult time, with 7W-1D-5L. 

The team began with 3 defeats on the group stage (1-2, 0-1, 0-1), one at home against [Gr√™mio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%AAmio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense) and two away, against Peruvian teams [Alianza Lima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alianza_Lima) and [Sporting Cristal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Cristal). Cruzeiro needed at least two wins to be part of the 3 teams to advance: they beat Gr√™mio 1-0 away, then Alianza Lima 2-0 at home, and - already qualified - 2-1 against Sporting Cristal.

**In the ro16**, Cruzeiro lost the 1st leg away to [El Nacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Deportivo_El_Nacional), 0-1. In the return leg, Cruzeiro opened 2-0, but the match ended 2-1, going to the penalties - where the star [Dida](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dida_%28futebolista%29) [defended two](https://youtu.be/BiTFGSEFdr8?t=50), and Cruzeiro advanced to the next stage.

**Gr√™mio would be their opponent in the quarter-finals**, and playing the first leg at home in the Mineir√£o, Cruzeiro won 2-0. In the 2nd leg, Cruzeiro opened 1-0, conceded two goals, and left the Olimpico stadium with a 1-2 defeat and qualified to the semis.

**In the semi-finals**, Cruzeiro met [Colo-Colo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colo-Colo). In the first leg, at home, the Brazilians won 1-0, after [this master-dumb action by Colo-Colo goalkeeper](https://youtu.be/VBKk7SPsfx8?t=7). In Chile, Cruzeiro were losing 1-3, [until they scored this savior goal at '63](https://youtu.be/KZ-c5iReF1U?t=28), taking it to the penalties. [Dida](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dida_%28futebolista%29) star shone again, [as he defended two penalties](https://youtu.be/KZ-c5iReF1U?t=40) and put Cruzeiro on the final.

**In the final** against [Sporting Cristal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Cristal), the first match would be played in Peru, which was pretty balanced and ended 0-0. In Brazil, [Dida saved Cruzeiro again](https://youtu.be/RPWXiZAHAh0?t=101), before [Elivelto scored the title goal at '75](https://youtu.be/RPWXiZAHAh0?t=134). **Cruzeiro were crowned Copa Libertadores champions for the second time**.

However, Cruzeiro only escaped relegation in the national league on the last match - the board only cared about the [Intercontinental Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Intercontinental_Cup#Match_details) in December against European champions [Borussia Dortmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund). They got [Bebeto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Roberto_Gama_de_Oliveira) and [Donizete](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmar_Donizete_C%C3%A2ndido) on loan just for this match, but they lost it 0-2.

**1998: the runner-up season**

Cruzeiro increased a lot in 1998 with the arrivals of [Fabio Junior](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1bio_J%C3%BAnior_Pereira), [M√ºller](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_Ant%C3%B4nio_Corr%C3%AAa_da_Costa) and [Valdo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdo_C%C3%A2ndido_de_Oliveira_Filho).

They finished 2nd in the Brazilian League, in the *Copa do Brasil* and in the *Copa Mercosul*. However, they won the State League for the third time in a row, and also won the Recopa Sudamericana against [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl%C3%A9tico_River_Plate) (2-0, 3-0). In the Copa Libertadores, they were knocked out in the round of 16 by the eventual champions, [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Vasco_da_Gama).

[Dida](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dida_%28futebolista%29) left at the end of the season to [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan).

**2000: third** ***Copa do Brasil*** **title, and the end of a glorious decade**

Cruzeiro played 13 matches, with 8W-5D, to secure the [2000 Copa do Brasil](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_do_Brasil_de_Futebol_de_2000#Confrontos) title. They notably beat [Athletico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Paranaense) (2-1, 2-2), [Botafogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botafogo_de_Futebol_e_Regatas) (3-2, 0-0), [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Futebol_Clube) (2-0, 2-2) and [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC) (0-0, 2-1).

**Highlights to the big final**, against [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC). Cruzeiro tied the 1st leg away 0-0, and were losing 0-1 at home in the 2nd leg. At '80, [Fabio Junior tied](https://youtu.be/yp96QAZ7n0U?t=342), but Cruzeiro needed one more goal. At '90, [Giovanni scored from this free-kick](https://youtu.be/yp96QAZ7n0U?t=497), to the despair of goalkeeper [Rogerio Ceni](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Ceni). [S√£o Paulo almost tied at '91](https://youtu.be/yp96QAZ7n0U?t=552), the match ended at '92, and **Cruzeiro won the Copa do Brasil title for their third time**.

**2003: the dream year**

[Luxemburgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Luxemburgo), former [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras), [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) and Brazil NT coach, took the job in late 2002, when the team was threatened of relegation, but got saved.

The new coach started building the team for the following season, and the result was an unprecedented **national triple crown** conquest, with the titles of the State League, the *Copa do Brasil* and the *Brasileir√£o*. Since the creation of the *Copa do Brasil* in 1989, the only teams that got close to winning both the Copa and the League was Cruzeiro in 1998, finishing second in both, and Corinthians in 2002, winning the Copa and losing the league's final.

But in 2003, Cruzeiro had a powerful and demolishing team that won it all. They started winning the State League undefeated, with 10W-2D. In the *Copa do Brasil*, they played 11 matches, with 8W-3D, beating [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_de_Regatas_Vasco_da_Gama) (2-1, 1-1), [Goi√°s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A1s_Esporte_Clube) (3-2, 2-1) and [Flamengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo) (1-1, 3-1) in the final. **Highlights** to [this back-heel goal by Alex in the final 1st leg](https://youtu.be/AxILnFWXXZo?t=14). Despite winning the *Copa*, Cruzeiro still had to prove themselves in the league, because between 2001 and 2012 the best teams in Brazil weren't allowed to play the *Copa do Brasil*, so that they could focus in the Copa Libertadores.

The [2003 Brazilian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_A#Standings) was the first one with a double round-robin and no play-offs in the history of the league. Cruzeiro biggest adversary were [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Futebol_Clube_%28S%C3%A3o_Paulo%29), current Brazilian champions and runner-up of the Copa Libertadores, hyped by the upcoming talents of [Diego](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Ribas_da_Cunha) and [Robinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinho). But Cruzeiro had [Alex](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexsandro_de_Souza), the most capped Brazilian player in history not to be called to a World Cup, a [Palmeiras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras), [Coritiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coritiba_Foot_Ball_Club) and [Fenerbah√ße](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah%C3%A7e_S.K.) idol. With him leading the team as a 10, they reached a rate of 72% on the league, over 46 matches, with a win rate of 67%. Cruzeiro led the league all the way around since the 8th round through the 46th round, with the exception of 2 rounds that [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Futebol_Clube_%28S%C3%A3o_Paulo%29) quickly led (16 and 28). Cruzeiro notably beat [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Futebol_Clube_%28S%C3%A3o_Paulo%29) 2-0 away and 3-0 at home, the latter match being seen as the most decisive of the league, in which Cruzeiro showed no mercy or fatigue. Until [Flamengo's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo) 2019 campaign, this was considered the most dominant display by a team in the ""Double Round-Robin National League Era (since 2003)"". However, the quality of the national league in 2003 was a couple of tiers above the 2019 one, making Cruzeiro accomplishment relatively more difficult to achieve than 2019 Flamengo's.

Until today, 2003 Cruzeiro is seen as **the most powerful** Brazilian team of the 21st century, along with 2010 Santos and 2019 Flamengo - in terms of aesthetics, strenght and superiority.

However, the team dismantled in early 2004, and couldn't reach higher levels anymore.

[This 48mn documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSxDMWKbXQE) tells the whole story of Cruzeiro triple-crown season. Three Cruzeiro players were elected to the [League Best XI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_de_Prata#2003), namely [Maurinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurinho_%28footballer,_born_1978%29), [Maldonado](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A1udio_Andr%C3%A9s_Del_Transito_Maldonado_Rivera) and [Alex](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexsandro_de_Souza), the latter also winning the League Golden Ball.

**2013-14: back-to-back Brazilian League champions**

After Cruzeiro's 2003 dream season, they reached the Copa Libertadores final in 2009, traumatically losing the final 1-2 at home to [Estudiantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estudiantes_de_La_Plata), after opening the score at '51 - they tied the 1st leg 0-0 in Argentina. In 2010, Cruzeiro was the Brazilian League runner-up. On the last league match in 2011, Cruzeiro feared relegation, but won the historical derby against their archrival [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro) by the score of 6-1, a derby record. Cruzeiro also won some state leagues here and there, but never managed in their whole history to surpass [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro) in overall state league titles - the closest was in 1930, when they had 3 titles each.

**In 2013 and 2014** Cruzeiro won back-to-back Brazilian League titles, reaching the number of 4 titles (1966, 2003, 2013, 2014). In 2013, Cruzeiro led 26 of 38 rounds, and had 5 players elected to the [League's Best XI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_de_Prata#2013): [F√°bio](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1bio_Deivson_Lopes_Maciel), [Mayke](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayke), [Ded√©](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Vital_da_Silva), [Nilton](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilton_Ferreira_J%C3%BAnior), and Golden Ball winner, [√âverton Ribeiro](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89verton_Ribeiro). In 2014, Cruzeiro led 32 of 38 league rounds, all consecutively since the 6th round - a league record, until 2017 [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) (33 leading rounds). Cruzeiro also had 2 players elected to the [League's Best XI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_de_Prata#2014): [Lucas Silva](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Silva) and Golden Ball winner, [Ricardo Goulart](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Goulart). Later that season, they had a shot at winning their second *national triple crown*, but lost the *Copa do Brasil* final to their archrival [Atl√©tico Mineiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro) (0-2, 0-1).

**Highlights** to [this *gola√ßo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXF8UcQWVg) of [√âverton Ribeiro](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89verton_Ribeiro) against [Flamengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo) in the 2013 *Copa do Brasil*.

**2017-2018: back-to-back** ***Copa do Brasil*** **champions**

**In 2017**, Cruzeiro won their 5th *Copa do Brasil* title, with 7W-5D-2L.

**2019-today**

In 2019, Cruzeiro went from being title favorites to being relegated to Serie B. Not only the club went through a huge financial/debt crisis, but also the club's expensive players chose not to care about the results - a shameful and enormous disengagement led by Cruzeiro's biggest villain and conspirator, the midfielder Thiago Neves. The club now fights against FIFA-debts punishments and is in the Serie B relegation zone to Serie C.

To this day, Cruzeiro has a fanbase of 7 million supporters, and a stadium attendance average of 24.200, as of 2019.

**Match Events**

**1‚Äô**: Kick off

**17‚Äô**: **CLOSE!** Nice move from United. Ighalo rounds the keeper but can‚Äôt quite find his feet to tuck it away.

**26‚Äô**: A nice team move sees Jahanbakhsh strike at goal from 20 yards. Henderson saves down to his right.

**43‚Äô**: Burn is shown a yellow card. 

**43‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAAL!!** Fantastic free kick from Mata whose free kick picks out McTominay at the back post. He has the simplest of tasks in nodding home from 6 yards.](https://streamja.com/jnQe7)

**Halftime**: Don‚Äôt let the scoreline fool you, it‚Äôs been a drab affair so far. Surely the second half can only get better?

**50‚Äô**: Maupay comes on to replace Jahanbakhsh.

**67‚Äô**: **CLOSE!** Henderson turns away Trossards close range shot. Great save. Pogba and Rashford then replace Ighalo and James.

**72‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAAL!** Van de Beek‚Äôs cute back heel plays Mata in. He twists and dummies to give himself a yard before placing it through the defenders legs and in to the bottom corner. Great composure from Mata.](https://streamja.com/vVQqM)

**79‚Äô**: [**GOAAAAAL** Pogba‚Äôs deflected free kick goes in to the top corner.

,,Qu√© mediocridad del Caracas vale.,1,mediocridad del caraca vale
Portugal National Team,"In October the national team games return . On this 1st of October, Fernando Santos announces the squad, who will face Spain (on the 7th), and that will defend the Nations League title in the two decisive games against France (on the 11th) and Sweden (on the 14th) ). With all the championships going on, let's see who should be on the national coach list.

This time, unlike the last call for games with Croatia and Sweden, this October list should not contain any debut. Incidentally, it should be almost identical also in view of the guarantees it gave.

Goalkeeper
With Anthony Lopes and Rui Patr√≠cio as certainties, the highlight goes to Rui Silva, who should again be the third option as guardian of the European Champion, he who was just one of the two debuts on the August list. He has now completed three games for Granada and seems to continue the excellent level of last season in the Spanish League, having even saved a penalty against Atl√©tico de Madrid last weekend. Jos√© S√°, from Olympiacos, is also a hypothesis.

Defenses


The first doubts arise in the defensive line. On the axis, the presence of Pepe, Jos√© Fonte and the new Manchester City player, R√∫ben Dias, are certain. The role of central room should fall on what is appointed as the replacement for the new ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù at Benfica: R√∫ben Semedo. The still Olympiacos player has the advantage of playing in the Champions League, having started in the access play-off on Tuesday. To be confirmed, the last one on the list will be Domingos Duarte, who, despite his quality, also did not have a great performance in that match with Atl√©tico de F√©lix, and his compatriot made his life difficult in that game. On the other hand, R√∫ben Semedo was infected with Covid-19 in August, which made his call impossible at the time.

On the right side, another question. If N√©lson Semedo has already made his debut for Wolverhampton, and must again be one of the chosen ones, for Jo√£o Cancelo the situation is more delicate. Despite the City player being the most prominent individual in the previous double match of the League of Nations, he arrived injured in England and has not played again. But will there really be any Portuguese on the rise at the moment for the position? Ricardo Pereira, who is usually seen as the third on the right, has not yet recovered from a serious injury. European champion C√©dric, on the other hand, has not earned the confidence to get any minute of play in Arsenal's right aisle. Who's left?

We could think of Andr√© Almeida, although he was never seen as a valid option by Fernando Santos. How about fishing in the national champion? Wilson Manaf√°, at a great level in recent months, is in fact the most solid of all the defenders mentioned here, a characteristic appreciated by the coach. Even so, knowing exactly another aspect of Fernando Santos (conservatism), if the ‚ÄúMister‚Äù calls Cancelo and he guarantees that he can be recovered for the first training session of the Selection, the ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù starts at the front line. But Manaf√° deserved an opportunity. Will there really be a rookie?

On the left side there is less room for doubts. Rapha√´l Guerreiro was finally back on the pitch by Dortmund, he who had also played the last game since the ""quinas"" team returned. The usual substitute is M√°rio Rui, but he hasn't played for Napoli this season. However, the options are not as wide as on the right, at least, according to the criteria of Fernando Santos, who also makes experience a strong condition. R√∫ben Vinagre has already played two games for Wolverhampton, but his profile is very similar to that of Guerreiro. Nuno Mendes has been Sporting's revelation, but in fact he still has a few minutes at the highest level. The experience of M√°rio Rui's 29 years gives him an advantage. A surprise would be pleasant.

 Midfield
Danilo, R√∫ben Neves, Bruno Fernandes and Jo√£o Moutinho untouchable. With the return of William to the pitch and in great for Betis (with two goals), Andr√© Gomes or S√©rgio Oliveira should take the turn in relation to the last call, even more if Renato Sanches is seen as a valid option for the center of the field, he who was in good shape at the heart of Lille's game against Nantes. He had even been called up in August, but he would not recover in time for an injury. And as everyone knows, Fernando Santos is very fond of the unique characteristics (strength, race, lungs, boldness, technique, so much in just one player) of the Golden Boy 2016. Thus, S√©rgio Oliveira should really be the discarded, and Andr√© Gomes, who has played solid games for Everton, should complete the options.

Forwards
Bernardo Silva has not yet played for City after his injury in Sweden, but the little ""conductor"" has returned to training and will be available to Guardiola for the next two games before the international break. Thus, it will always be the first option for (false) extreme right. The second element expected is the new handsome boy from Portugal and even‚Ä¶ from Barcelona! Trinc√£o had already substituted Bernardo against Croatia, in his debut in Fernando Santos' choices. He has already debuted in La Liga and trains every day with world players like Messi. On the other hand, it offers different characteristics, for a right runner of the complementary attack.

On the left it is more complicated to make predictions, since, lately, all profiles were also facing the center of the attack. Assuming that Cristiano Ronaldo still flirts from the left and that Diogo Jota was the unit that numerically (and well) replaced the Portuguese star - who already has three goals in two games at Juventus - in Croatia's ‚Äúeleven‚Äù, both are right cards . Not to mention that Jota is in high spirits, with his dream debut at Liverpool, scoring a beautiful goal against Arsenal.

There remains a place to reach 23, and Jo√£o F√©lix is ‚Äã‚Äãanother guarantee for Fernando Santos, as for any football aficionado. He started big at Atl√©tico de Madrid (a goal, an assist, got a penalty, and assumed himself as a sublime ‚Äúorchestra‚Äù leader). Conclusion: it is very likely that, as in the last call, two more names are on the list. Andr√© Silva started as he ended up at Frankfurt, collecting goals. So it must remain on the list. Gon√ßalo Guedes, too, but his low performance at Valencia does not allow him to be so perpetual. In fact, it wasn't even a field option against Real Sociedad‚Ä¶ But who can threaten the place?

Even Pizzi has not been better at Benfica and Gon√ßalo Paci√™ncia is still getting used to Schalke. Paulinho? If you didn't count after the superb season at Braga, it won't be this one. Fernando Santos will hardly abdicate Guedes's versatility, who can play both on the left and behind the striker

 - In his 3rd year on contract (season 2022/23) Otamendi' salary will be paid just by Benfica, for an amount of 2M‚Ç¨ after taxes.

 - 'Program Regressar' - The legislation passed in 2019, means that  for people that returning to the country (in case they left before 2016) they would have up to 50% reduction in taxes. This applies to other players like Pepe.

**Exclusive: Government Provides Bailout To National League Clubs To Keep Them Afloat And Prevent Them Withdrawing From FA Cup**

The Government has now made clear it will underwrite losses made by clubs after forcing them to play behind closed doors by scrapping Thursday's planned return of fans to elite football.

The uncertainty over whether it would intervene had threatened to throw the world's oldest cup competition into chaos, with non-league clubs on the brink of withdrawal to avoid triggering player contracts that must be honoured for the rest of the campaign.

Speaking before the Government pledge was made, club secretary Luke Shelley said: ""We've had no confirmation from anybody that we're having any financial support. So we won't be starting the season on Saturday - and that includes the FA Cup."".

The Isthmian League Premier Division club said in a statement: ""As the coronavirus is clearly clever enough to differentiate between supporters of Step 2 and 3 clubs, in their wisdom, supporters of National League clubs - which include Dulwich Hamlet - are banned from spectating.

""We have held back on the sale of tickets for the time being but will unfortunately have to limit these to Corinthian-Casuals and neutral supporters only. Other National League clubs had been desperately trying to amend player contracts on Tuesday to avoid them triggering season-long payments.

Chorley FC chief executive Terry Robinson said: ""The last thing we want to do is not enter the FA Cup but we have to be careful about the future of the club.""",1,summari articl http smmri http telegraph footbal exclus govern provid bailout leagu length exclus govern provid bailout leagu keep afloat prevent withdraw cup govern made clear underwrit loss made forc behind close scrap thursday plan return elit footbal uncertainti whether would interven threaten throw world oldest cup competit chao leagu brink withdraw avoid trigger player contract must honour rest campaign speak govern pledg made secretari luke shelley said confirm anybodi financi support start season saturday includ cup isthmian leagu premier divis said statement coronaviru clearli clever enough differenti support step wisdom support leagu includ dulwich hamlet spectat held sale ticket unfortun limit corinthian casual neutral support leagu desper amend player contract tuesday avoid trigger season payment chorley chief terri robinson said thing want enter cup care futur

,,"We weren't good enough today unfortunately, although in the 1st half we had our chances which could have changed the game. Credit to Olympiakos, they were the better side in both games and their quality showed, especially in both second halves. I am still absolutely ecstatic that we get to play in a European competition for the 1st time in our history and even if we are knocked out of the Champions League, I don't feel particularly sad, nor does any Omonoia fan I think. Some of the positives were the fight our players showed in the 1st half and their discipline up to the 60th min. The negatives are that we absolutely suck going forward and this will definitely be a problem in the group stages and the league as well. Also, the fact that our players are getting tired so easily (statistically we concede the most and score the less after the 60 minute mark) and we don't have viable substitutions is worrying, although I trust our youth players.

As for Saint-Etienne's Wesley Fofana, hopes are now very low given the evaluation of the French Club, valued at 40 million euros (an offer of 30 million from Leicester was refused). The conditions are impractical at the moment for Milan.

However, the interest in Takehiro Tomiyasu of Bologna remains alive. There have already been contacts with the rossobl√π club, talks that could continue in the next few hours to understand the feasibility of the operation. Bologna has set a starting price of at least 25 million for the Japanese defender.

In the Rossoneri's list of preferences for the defender role in the first two places there are Fofana and Tomiyasu respectively.

,,"Manchester City are planning a move for a new left back, but the deal is contingent on the club managing to sell Oleksandr Zinchenko first.

City‚Äôs summer spending total is set to reach ¬£121 million when they complete the ¬£65 million signing of R√∫ben Dias, the 23-year-old central defender, from Benfica.

Dias may not be the last new addition to Pep Guardiola‚Äôs squad this summer, however, as City are looking at adding a new left back to their squad to provide Benjamin Mendy with some competition.

Guardiola does not want to have three left backs in his squad when the window closes on Monday so Zinchenko will have to be moved on, while Spaniard Angeli√±o is back on loan again at RB Leipzig for the entirety of this season.

Zinchenko has been a handy squad member for Guardiola since he joined City from Russian club FC Ufa for ¬£1.5 million in 2016. The 23-year-old Ukrainian joined as an attacking midfielder, but has filled in at left back for most of his time at City.


Guardiola now wants a specialist left back to replace Zinchenko. Barcelona are interested in signing the defender as a back-up to Jordi Alba.

Should Zinchenko leave, City will sign a replacement and David Alaba of Bayern Munich is thought to be of interest. Alaba, 28, played 77 league games under Guardiola during his three-year spell in charge of Bayern. The Austrian defender has so far been unable to agree terms on an extension to his contract with Bayern, which expires on June 2021.

Bayern have intimated that they would be happy for Alaba to see out the final year of his contract, but if that is the case, the full back would be entitled to leave on a free transfer next summer.

Nicol√°s Tagliafico, the Ajax left back, is also of interest to City, but it appears unlikely that the 28-year-old Argentine will be allowed to leave this summer. Ajax do not like to sell more than one or two of their first-team players every summer and this year they have already sold Donny van de Beek and Hakim Ziyech to Manchester United and Chelsea respectively for a combined total of just over ¬£70 million. Sergi√±o Dest, the 19-year-old Ajax right back, is also set to join Barcelona for ¬£22.9 million, so the Dutch club feel that their chances of winning the league will be compromised if they let Tagliafico leave too.


Now that City have secured the signing of Dias, Barcelona are set to step up their interest in Eric Garc√≠a.

Garc√≠a, 19, told City earlier this year that he wants to rejoin his boyhood club and will not therefore be signing an extension to his contract, which expires at the end of this season.

City are still insistent, however that they will not accept a big of less than ‚Ç¨30 million (¬£27.4 million) for the Spanish centre back, although they only want two thirds of the fee up front. City rejected a ¬£9 million bid for the teenager earlier this month.

Garc√≠a is rated highly by Guardiola, but the Catalan has accepted that the defender wants to leave and he already has four centre backs in his squad in Dias, Aymeric Laporte, Nathan Ak√© and John Stones. Nicol√°s Otamendi, the 32-year-old defender, is set to complete his ¬£14 million move to Benfica in the next 24 hours.",1,manchest citi plan move new left deal conting manag sell oleksandr zinchenko first citi summer spend total set reach million complet million sign year central defend benfica may new addit pep guardiola squad summer howev citi look new left squad provid benjamin mendi competit guardiola want left squad window close monday zinchenko move spaniard loan leipzig entireti season zinchenko handi squad member guardiola sinc citi russian ufa million year ukrainian midfield fill left citi guardiola want specialist left replac zinchenko barcelona interest sign defend jordi alba zinchenko leav citi sign replac david alaba bayern munich thought interest alaba leagu game guardiola year spell charg bayern austrian defend unabl agre term extens contract bayern expir june bayern intim would happi alaba see final year contract case would entitl leav transfer next summer nicol tagliafico ajax left also interest citi appear unlik year argentin leav summer ajax like sell first team player everi summer year alreadi sold donni beek hakim ziyech manchest unit chelsea respect combin total million sergi year ajax also set barcelona million dutch feel chanc leagu compromis tagliafico leav citi secur sign barcelona set step interest garc garc told citi earlier year want rejoin boyhood therefor sign extens contract expir season citi still insist howev accept million million spanish centr although want fee front citi million teenag earlier month garc highli guardiola catalan accept defend want leav alreadi centr squad aymer laport nathan john stone nicol otamendi year defend set complet million move benfica next hour

0‚Äô: Arsenal get the game underway.

2‚Äô: Mane is shown a yellow card for a ‚Äòpush‚Äô to the face/shoulder of Tierney.

11‚Äô: Luiz clears a Van-Dijk header that looked goal bound. It may have been going wide

21‚Äô: **CLOSE!** Trent‚Äôs deflected cross bounces back off the crossbar.

25‚Äô: [**GOAAAAAAAL!** A huge error from Robertson deflects the ball straight to Lacazette. His scuffed shot loops over Alisson to make it 0-1](https://streamja.com/warG7)

48‚Äô: Trent is shown a yellow card for a late tackle.

60‚Äô: Ceballos replaces Xhaka

87‚Äô: [**GOAAAAAAL** Debut goal from Jota who sneaks a shot in from a Luiz clearance. That should put the game beyond any doubt now.](https://streamye.com/vby24)

90‚Äô: Minamino replaces Firmino.

&gt;Preston North End have lost their appeal against the straight red card shown to Tom Barkhuizen on Saturday against Stoke City, but there has been a reduced punishment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The FA dismissed PNE's appeal but decided that the three match ban was excessive and so it has been reduced to one game.  
&gt;  
&gt;He will therefore not be available for the trip to Brentford on Sunday and will be back in contention for the home clash against Cardiff City on October 18.  
&gt;  
&gt;With just over 20 minutes played against at Deepdale last weekend, Mr Donohue gave Barkhuizen his marching orders for a slide challenge on defender Morgan Fox.  
&gt;  
&gt;Replays soon showed that the No.29 had quite clearly slipped into the position, therefore leaving it to look as though he had gone in two-footed.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the first red card of his career and proved the decisive moment as the visitors went on to win the game 0-1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neil was confident after seeing the incident back on Saturday, that Barkhuizen would be in contention for the next fixture - not having the forward available will be a blow, especially away from home.  
&gt;  
&gt;""For people who've been involved in football, certainly ex-players like myself, when you look at that you quickly establish whether someone has gone in with intent or just been unfortunate and lost their footing,"" Neil had said post-match.

"Juve, Han's transfer breaches the United Nations sanctions: 'We asked them to block the transfer'",,,1,juve transfer breach unit sanction ask transfer
,,"After the beginning blazing between Cagliari and Perugia, it had earned the call of the Juventus. In bianconero, however, Han Kwang-Son didn't manage to impose himself, not even with the Under 23, and therefore, in January, the Bianconeri gave him to Al-Duahil in Qatar. 7 games, 3 consecutive goals between February and March, some certainty found. Now, however, the transfer of the North Korean forward ends under observation. 

&amp;#x200B;

POLITICAL REASONS - The reason? Political. The transfer contravenes, writes L'Equipe, the resolutions prohibiting North Koreans from working abroad, as underlined by a report of the United Nations Security Council linked to international sanctions to force North Korea to renounce nuclear power. 

&amp;#x200B;

THE MESSAGE - ""Although the Council immediately contacted Italy about Mr. Han's transfer, this has not been cancelled. The Council then again reported to Qatar the resolutions relating to this case"", reads the report. The UN had asked the Member States to submit their reports on the expulsion measures of the North Koreans, which were to be sent home by December 2019. Juve first redeemed the footballer from Cagliari (he had passed into black and white on loan in August 2019) and then sold the footballer in Qatar in January 2020 for 7 million euros.

The Germany 2014 World Cup winning squad: Where are they now?,"During the latest season break both Andr√© Sch√ºrrle and Benedikt H√∂wedes announced their retirement from football having both achieved the ultimate prize with their country back in 2014. Since that incredible victory in Brazil, the team has experienced a quite drastic change in fortunes and personnel, despite manager Joachim L√∂w still overseeing the German side. 
Some of the 23-man squad remain at the top level, with the stars of others fading; here then, is where the victorious 2014 Germany World Cup squad are now‚Ä¶

**#1 ‚Äì Manuel Neuer ‚Äì Goalkeeper ‚Äì Bayern Munich** 


Winning the Golden Glove in 2014, Manuel Neuer was undeniably the best goalkeeper in the world back in 2014 and his name was even in the hat for the Ballon d'Or, coming 3rd with a healthy 15% of the votes, especially considering the freakish talent he was up against with Messi and Ronaldo (who won it) ahead of him.


Nowadays he captains the side to regular Bundesliga titles and is still as quick-reflexed as ever, sensing danger from with predator-like precision and bailing out rare errors from his back line. Injury problems seem to be behind him too, and he‚Äôs still holding down the number 1 jersey for the national side. 


He‚Äôll undoubted have his eye on a 9th Bundesliga trophy and a 3rd Champion‚Äôs League winner‚Äôs medal in the next 12 months, being the serial winner he is.



**#2 ‚Äì Kevin Gro√ükreutz ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Free Agent** 


A lifelong Borussia Dortmund fan-become-legend, nobody on this list‚Äôs star has fallen quite like that of Gro√ükreutz.


Having left the side he adored in 2015, things went downhill faster than a Sadio Mane hattrick; some factors out of his hands, but other issues were firmly of his own ridiculous doing.  
First came the paperwork issue as the big bossmen at Galatasary failed to submit the relevant documents in time, meaning the defender was ineligible to feature until January 1st. FIFA rejected any appeal and Gro√ükreutz collected his paycheck before returning to Germany on January 6th without a single showing for the Turkish club. 


It was Stuttgart who bought him back home and the player looked happy to be back on the field, but the club were unable to retain their Bundesliga status, finishing 17th and being relegated for the first time in 41 years. The worst was yet to come though‚Ä¶


Four days after being in a bar fight which saw he and a 16-year old be taken to hospital and a further four suspects arrested, the club terminated Kevin‚Äôs contract by mutual consent. ‚ÄúI made a mistake and for that I‚Äôm very sorry. I accept the consequences and regret that my time at Stuttgart has come to an end in this way,‚Äù said Gro√ükreutz before adding ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to do with football for the time being.‚Äù


One month later, he signed for Darmstadt 98. Make of that what you will. 


Recently e was kicked out of Uerdingen and has now sued the club over outstanding salary payments. Additionally he has resigned as manager of Landesliga (6th tier) club T√ºrkspor Dortmund which he coached for a year. The man lives for the drama.





**#3 ‚Äì Matthias Ginter ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Borussia M√∂nchengladbach**


The youngest player on this list, Matthias Ginter was just 20 when he was selected for the World Cup squad following an impressive season with Freiburg.


After the World Cup he signed for Borussia Dortmund before switching to his current club, M√∂nchengladbach, in 2017 where he has performed to a very strong level, helping the side return to the Champion‚Äôs League last season, a feat the side will be looking to repeat in the 20-21 campaign.



**#4 ‚Äì Benedikt H√∂wedes ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired**


Here he is then, the first of the retirees and a bonafide Schalke legend. 


H√∂wedes somewhat surprisingly featured in every single minute of the 2014 triumph, along with Neuer and captain Philipp Lahm ‚Äì he was exceptionally reliable and versatile, slotting into the left back role with ease and providing the solid performances expected of him throughout. He almost opened the scoring in the final too, his header cannoning off the post late in the first half, placing him centimeters from immortality.  


Having racked up 240 professional games for Schalke, a vast number of which as captain, he departed on loan to Juventus in 2017. Sadly, the injuries had caught up with him incredibly quickly, resulting in H√∂wedes only being able to feature in 3 games for the Italian champions.


A move to Lokomotiv Moscow followed, ending his 17-year affiliation with Schalke. After two seasons in Russia, the club and player agreed to terminate his contract by mutual consent due to family reasons with his retirement arriving less than two months later, on July 31st of this year. 


**#5 ‚Äì Mats Hummels ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Borussia Dortmund**


Another sure-fire legend of the professional game; Mats Hummels has been a leader at the heart of every defensive line he‚Äôs featured within. Scoring a couple of goals at the tournament, including the vital winner against France in the quarters, Hummels was a shining light of this German era.



A Bayern youth player, Mats made the unholy switch back to the champions in 2016 following over 200 games for BVB. There, he would win three league titles, adding to his two previous collected with Dortmund, before making the ¬£30 million return to the yellow and black, where he remains today, having had a wonderful season back towards the peak of his elegant defensive powers. 


Most noteworthy however, is that he was one of three veteran players (alongside J√©r√¥me Boateng and Thomas M√ºller) who L√∂w would no longer be considering for selection as of 2019. Many have questioned this decision, especially given Germany‚Äôs less-than-consistent performances over the past couple of years, but the finger sniffer has held firm, and Hummels hasn‚Äôt featured in the national side since 2018.

**#6 ‚Äì Sami Khedira ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Juventus**


The ticking midfield maestro at the heart of the 2014 midfield, Khedira had another exceptional tournament to follow on from his 2010 success which saw him move to Real Madrid, where he won everything Spanish football has to offer. 


As his contract expired with Madrid, he was picked up by Juventus, in typical free transfer fashion. A consistent performer in Italy, introducing others into play delightfully, he‚Äôs managed a tidy amount of goals over his five-year Italian tenure too.


Injuries have really started to ramp up however, and his legs are getting heavier on the field, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to see him depart The Old Lady come the end of his contract in summer.


**#7 ‚Äì Bastian Schweinsteiger ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Retired**


Rightly hailed by Joachim L√∂w as one of the greatest footballers Germany has ever produced, Bastian Schweinsteiger enjoyed an illustrious career at Bayern Munich, racking up 500 games across all competitions and playing a variety of important roles through the years.


For many, he was man of the match in the 2014 final. Man-marking Messi out of the game for massive periods, controlling the midfield and launching attacks from deep ‚Äì without him, the result could have been very different. Truly his finest hour.


Post World Cup injury issues became ever clearer (this is becoming a bit of a theme, isn‚Äôt it), and with his career in Germany winding down, a switch to Louis van Gaal‚Äôs Manchester United army ensued. Sadly though, he struggled to pick up the pace the side demanded, and it never really felt like he achieved what was hoped of him at Old Trafford. Mourinho‚Äôs arrival spelt the end for the German, being harshly treated and effectively pushed out of the squad and placed on the unwanted list.


As a result, he moved to Chicago Fire in the MLS and performed really well, seemingly having a new lease of life as he looked to guide the club to World Cup victory, if some journalists are to be believed‚Ä¶


Retirement in 2019 followed and he now works as a pundit, casting his footballing brain across the airwaves.



**#8 ‚Äì Mesut √ñzil ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Arsenal**
During the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and for every season in between, Mesut √ñzil was one of the finest players on the planet; a serial assister who glided across the pitch with craftsmenship and fluidity like no other, he was the heartbeat of the attack for Germany, Real Madrid and Arsenal.


Having experienced massive success at Werder Bremen and Real Madrid, his move to Arsenal in 2013 was met with glee, as another giant of the game was set to make a splash in the Premier League ‚Äì and splash he did. It‚Äôs easy to forget due to Arsenal‚Äôs turgid recent years, that for many years √ñzil way THE man for Arsenal.

 
Nowadays, he‚Äôs sometimes not even bench warming, and instead is smashing Fortnite whilst collecting his ¬£350,000 per week and failing to make any sort of impact within the plans of Arteta and Unai Emery before him.


The real controversy lies in his retirement from the national team though. 


After being pictured with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan (along with ƒ∞lkay G√ºndoƒüan) fans were outraged, as the image was seen as an endorsement of the president‚Äôs highly controversial policies. The DFB publicly distance themselves from the situation, but following a frankly horrendous 2018 World Cup campaign, the issue reared its head again.


√ñzil addressed the concerns, stating that they solely discussed football, not politics, and that he was simply respecting the office of his family‚Äôs nation. He even battled back by zoning in on a potential lack of criticism received by Lothar Matth√§us, who had met with Russian president Vladimir Putin before going on to accuse Reinhard Grindel, the DFB president, of racism. He promptly stepped down from the nation side in protest of his treatment, sparking yet more criticism in the direction of the Arsenal attacking midfielder. 


Nothing has changed since, but there was that occasion in 2019 when Erdoƒüan was best man at √ñzil‚Äôs wedding. I‚Äôm sure they only spoke about football though‚Ä¶


**#9 ‚Äì Andr√© Sch√ºrrle ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Retired**


The man who assisted that famous winning goal, Andr√© Sch√ºrrle, has experienced a turbulent career following the World Cup win. 


Leaving Chelsea in 2015 having never cemented his place in the starting line-up, he moved to Wolfsburg for approximately ¬£22 million, performing to a high level in the green shirt and pushing him back towards the very top of his game. The result, a move to Borussia Dortmund for another sizeable fee but again his career took a nosedive. 


Injuries struck, and alongside it, poor performances.


A loan move to Fulham showed promise, including a banging goal against Burnley, but he wasn‚Äôt the player Premier League had witnessed 4 years prior as Fulham dropped down to the Championship at the first time of asking. Another loan to Spartak Moscow failed to spark an upturn in form and retirement followed at just 29 years of age, with Sch√ºrrle stating that he no longer wanted to face the loneliness and endless competition of top-tier football.


A beauty to watch on his day, it‚Äôs a real shame he never quite acheievd what was anticipated of him. At least we‚Äôll always have that assist, and that performance against Brazil in the infamous 7-1, everyone else had downed tools, but Sch√ºrrle, brilliantly, was having none of that.

**#10 ‚Äì Lukas Podolski ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Antalyaspor** 


Despite playing a bit-part in this crowning moment for his country, Lukas Podolski will live long in the memory of German fans, with wonderful World Cup campaigns in both 2006 and 2010 and a team of the tournament appearance at Euro 2008.


The King of K√∂ln, possessing unreal speed a foot like a traction engine, often saved his very best for the German national side, and is a cult hero for many across the globe.
Having played in Germany, England, Italy and Japan and now Turkey with Antalyaspor, the man is best known for his dual spells at FC K√∂ln where he racked up a mightily impressive 79 league goals, using his explosive pace to maximum effect in the Bundesliga.


Nowadays, when he‚Äôs not appearing in the Turkish S√ºper Lig, he putting his well-earned cash to a good cause, having founded the Lukas Podolski Foundation for Sport and Education which aims to give prospects to disadvantaged children and young people, fight child poverty, and promote social inclusion and integration and understanding among nations.



**#11 ‚Äì Miroslav Klose ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Retired**


I simply cannot do this man justice in words. 


The all-time leading goal scorer in World Cup history, having converted in the famous 7-1 demolition of Brazil (surpassing Ronaldo Naz√°rio‚Äôs as he went), Klose retired from the national side following his greatest triumph. 


Whilst well-regarded as a scoring machine for both club and country, he is often boxed in as simply an aerial threat when in reality, he is far more than that. Possessing a rapid change of pace, strong build-up abilities and ultimately, some of the finest movement you‚Äôre ever likely to see, Klose was a complete striker. Plus, he could even pull off a somersault celebration, and what‚Äôs not to love about that.


Spending almost his entire club career in Germany, he eventually retired at Lazio with, as expected, a solid scoring record.


Having been part of the national side‚Äôs coaching set-up, he is now second-in-command to the incredible Hansi Flick at Bayern, where his tactical nous is certain to help him to flourish into a blooming boss in future.  


**#12 ‚Äì Ron-Robert Zieler ‚Äì Goalkeeper ‚Äì FC K√∂ln**


Imagine making your professional debut with Northampton Town and ending up in a World Cup winning squad. That‚Äôd be bloody mint.


A Manchester United youth prospect, Zieler carved out a fantastic career for himself. The goalkeeper made over 200 appearances across two spells for Hannover and had a strong season with Stuttgart before a second tricky term, when he scored a calamitous own goal against Bremen. Caught out pulling his socks up when a throw-in came his way, he miscontrolled the ball and was forced to dive in vain as the ball trickled into the net. If that isn‚Äôt legacy, I don‚Äôt know what is.


Now he sits happily on the bench for FC K√∂ln, but if Timo Horn continues his current form, he could find himself between the sticks once more.

 

**#13 ‚Äì Thomas M√ºller ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Bayern Munich**


The Bundesliga champion, assist master, space-invader, world cup top scorer, Germany centurion. What can be said about M√ºller that hasn‚Äôt been already. He‚Äôs perennially underrated, being one of the finest and most consistent players of a generation. 


Aged just 24 when the 2014 contest rolled around, he had already accumulated 49 international appearances, and followed on from his destruction of England and Argentina in 2010 with another 5 goals at the finals, pairing a silver boot with his previous gold in South Africa.


The man has hardly missed a beat since, with his only real blip coinciding with the turbulent tenure of Niko Kovaƒç. Now at 30 years of age, he‚Äôs leading Bayern to yet more league glory, with this year‚Äôs Champion‚Äôs League being a cherry atop his sporting cake. 


As mentioned earlier however, M√ºller has been frozen out of the Germany squad by Joachim L√∂w, seemingly one of the scapegoats of the group stage exit in Russia. He stated that he was ‚Äúangry and surprised‚Äù by the dropping of himself and his fellow teammates and given his incredible form (particularly this past season) it is more than understandable as to why.



**#14 ‚Äì Julian Draxler ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Paris Saint-Germain**



Destined for great things was young Julian. You‚Äôd have found him floating around the top of many a top prospect lists around the time of the tournament in Brazil; and whilst he‚Äôs had a more than respectable career in many a sense, he hasn‚Äôt truly hit the heights expected of him during those early Schalke days.


After moving onto Wolsburg for a hefty sum, it felt like Draxler was set to kick his career into the upper gears, helping the club reach the Champion‚Äôs League quarter finals for the first time ever. However, the club felt he had not met up to the lofty expectations and Draxler duly wished to move on. 


Offers arrived but it would take until Christmas Eve later that year when PSG would stump up ‚Ç¨42 million to secure his services, ending what the midfielders described as ‚Äúthe worst first half of a season of my career.‚Äù


He only made 20 appearances across all competitions for the French capital club in the previous term, without registering a single goal. Maybe the farmers have too much for him and again, it may be time to move on.

**#15 ‚Äì Erik Durm ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Eintracht Frankfurt**


When I heard Huddersfield Town were signing former World Cup winning defender you better believe my fantasy football senses were tingling off the charts.


The tingling was short lived. Huddersfield finished bottom and Durm was an absolute shadow of the player many Yorkshire fans had expected. But enough about the bad part, let‚Äôs hear some good.
With BVB he had some good times, racking up a tidy half century of appearances in the yellow and black, and now he‚Äôs back in the Bundesliga with Frankfurt where he hopes to reignite his career on home soil.



**#16 ‚Äì Philipp Lahm ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired** 


Captaining a side as gargantuan as this is no easy task, and there aren‚Äôt too many captains that measure up to the golden goose that is Philipp Lahm. 


Lahm was the ultimate in high-level versatility, playing in the back line and midfield, with technical ability and tackling acumen on either foot ‚Äì he‚Äôs also one of the most tactically intelligent players I‚Äôve ever had the joy of watching, always appearing in the correct position and barely breaking stride to disrupt opposition moves. 


At the World Cup he was imperious, starring in multiple positions and staking his claim as one of the best players at the tournament. Watching him lift the trophy (a first for unified Germany) was a joy to be hold and the highlight of a career that included a multitude of awards.


Should he move into management, I have no doubt he would be a success, given his second-to-none understanding of the game. Plus, he‚Äôs a wonderful man, helping to support a number of charities and advocating for tolerance of homosexuality in football.



**#17 ‚Äì Per Mertesacker ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired**


Back in the day Per Mertesacker was one of the most effective centre backs in Europe. At Hannover and Werder Bremen he established himself as a sensible centre back with an exceptional understanding of the game and disciplinary record. Obviously dominant in the air (being a whopping 6 foot 7) it is often forgotten how cool the man was with the ball at his feet ‚Äì sure, he has a lack of pace, but was rarely caught out in the Bundesliga or internationally.


At the German World Cup in 2006, the 2008 Euros and the 2010 World Cup Mertesacker was a regular feature, showing a strong partnership with Christian Metzelder at the heart of defence. The emergence of Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber and J√©r√¥me Boateng ultimately played into the stepping back of Mertesacker, but he‚Äôll be fondly remembered at international level.
At Arsenal, he was a great leader and player, but injuries derailed his later years. 


His performance in the 2017 FA Cup final will live long in the memory ‚Äì having not started all season, he rolled back the years and put in a titanic performance, leading Arsenal to yet another FA Cup triumph. He‚Äôs still at Arsenal now, as he manages the academy and continues to showcase his professionalism and desire to the next generation. 



**#18 ‚Äì Toni Kroos ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Real Madrid**


You obviously don‚Äôt win the World Cup nowadays without a premium squad, but the stacked level of this squad this squad is just absurd.

   
At the time of the tournament Kroos was still a Bayern player, moving to Madrid shortly after and continuing his meteoric to the top of the midfield tree. His incredible performance in that 7-1 demolition was a huge statement on the biggest stage, yet he still somehow moved for just under ¬£30 million. One of the transfers of the millennium without a doubt.


He‚Äôs been a constant at the spine of the side since, forming a fruitful relationship with both Casemiro and Modric, helping to capture La Decima, the first of a hattrick of Champion‚Äôs League trophies for Toni in white.


And he‚Äôs still doing it to this day, dictating tempo, snaffling attacks and scoring the occasional banger (see Germany v Sweden at the Russia World Cup), simply put, he can do it all and we‚Äôre incredibly lucky to be able to witness a player of his calibre week in, week out.



**#19 ‚Äì Mario G√∂tze ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Free Agent**


From a talent fully realised, to one who was destined for so much more.


After coming off the bench in the final and quite brilliantly squeezing home the winning extra time goal G√∂tze had punched a one-way ticket to mega stardom, individual awards and championship glory throughout his career. 


And whilst much of this success reigns true, the train much have gotten a little lost en route to the destination. A mixture of less-than-incredible form and ultimately, a metabolic disorder which causes the fibres of the muscles to not function correct, meant young Mario pulled into the station a few stops short of the all-time greats. 


Now he‚Äôs a free agent, and the versatile forward could be of some use to a number of Bundesliga sides, depending on who can afford his wage demands. Who knows what the future will hold for the 28 year old, but I‚Äôm sure everyone hopes he‚Äôll be able to somehow rediscover that electric form that put him on the roadmap in the first place. 



**#20 ‚Äì J√©r√¥me Boateng ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Bayern Munich**


The younger brother of Ghana‚Äôs Kevin Prince-Boateng, J√©r√¥me backed his abilities when leaving Manchester City in search of more playing time in central defence, rather the being farmed out at right back. 


People weren‚Äôt sure he was good enough, but not only did he talk the talk, he walked the walk, ran the run and showed everyone in England exactly what they had been missing, becoming one of the most decorated defenders the game has ever seen along the way.


Sure, there have been some downs (mainly Kovaƒç dropping him and Messi imploding his ankles with the force of one thousand suns) but its been a career in Germany full of ups, including last season. With David Alaba moving to centre back, Boateng was imperious, cleaning up attacks and helping build from the base of Bayern‚Äôs traditional 4-2-3-1, helping the side add yet another European trophy to their illustrious cabinet. 


This year will be more of a challenge than the last given Flick‚Äôs pancake-thin squad, but Boateng will likely shine once again before inevitably moving to Manchester United as his decline hits.



**#21 ‚Äì Shkodran Mustafi ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Arsenal**


Everton &gt; Sampdoria &gt; Valencia &gt; Arsenal ‚Äì Shkodran Mustafi has had quite the memorable career path thus far. 


Eligible to represent Germany, North Macedonia and Albania, Mustafi made the right choice in opting to appear for his birth nation, appearing as a substitute throughout the 2014 tournament, and getting his hands on sport‚Äôs greatest prize.


Following the tournament, he moved to Spain and was one of the standout centre backs in La Liga, hence why Arsenal came sniffing for his signature. Surprising as it may be, he hasn‚Äôt always been the meme player he is now and he‚Äôs definitely shown a return to form under Arteta, whether he‚Äôs the standard they require anymore remains to be see, but this season will likely tell all.


**#22 ‚Äì Roman Weidenfeller ‚Äì Goalkeeper ‚Äì Retired**


Another Dortmund legend, Roman Weidenfeller was unfortunate to only total 5 international games for Germany, largely due to the wealth of goalkeeping talent they‚Äôve had the pleasure of selecting from throughout the years.



Having played for the black and yellow club from 2002 to 2018 he was the number one choice for many a year, until being overhauled by current keeper, Roman B√ºrki.


Still on the payroll at the club, he continues to work for BVB as an international ambassador.



**#23 ‚Äì Christoph Kramer ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Borussia M√∂nchengladbach**


Last but absolutely not least, it‚Äôs the man who had the weirdest experience of the final by far.


Starting his first game at the tournament due to Sami Khedira‚Äôs last minute injury, he suffered a concussion early in the match following a collision with Argentinian defender Garay, eventually being replaced by Andr√© Sch√ºrrle. The real kicker was that Kramer spent 14 minutes charging about the pitch in typical fashion before famously asking the referee whether it was the final that he was playing in, prompting his much-needed substitution. 


Providing strength and leadership in the centre of the park, Kramer now turns out for M√∂nchengladbach where he is soon to rack up a century of appearances.",,1,germani world cup squad latest season

The same can't be said about Tarkowski because he is 28 years old. 

Also, Fofana will be more willing to sit on the bench and wait for his chance than Tarkowski.

I hope it makes sense. Puel normally plays with a higher defensive line than Burnley, right? So he'll be more used to that. 

Whichever option we choose, there'll be some amount of risk accompanying it. I hope it works out. 40M is a large sum for us.

,,"L‚Äô√âquipe report that Premier League side Leicester City over the weekend made a 4th bid for 19-year-old French central defender Wesley Fofana to St √âtienne, worth a total of ‚Ç¨40m.

The new deal offered is ‚Ç¨35m in cash plus ‚Ç¨5m in potential bonuses for a player currently contracted to Les Verts until June 2024.

The St √âtienne board is now facing a considerable dilemma. Last Thursday, they were all behind manager Claude Puel‚Äôs point of view that Fofana should not be sold during this window no matter what the offer is, when they took the collective decision to reject Leicester City‚Äôs 3rd offer (‚Ç¨32m) and West Ham United‚Äôs ‚Ç¨35m bid.

Fofana found a contract agreement with the Foxes a month ago and they are his preferred destination. His relationship with Puel has soured as the French tactician refuses to engage with the teenager on this subject as Fofana seeks to force an exit.

St √âtienne‚Äôs board met on Monday and have neither accepted nor rejected Leicester‚Äôs latest proposal yet ‚Äì it would appear as if the board is now split in terms of what to do.

It's all to play for for all teams as it looks set to be close matchups for the 6 matches taking place this week.

In the Champions Path, RB Salzburg bring back home a 2-1 lead against Maccabi Tel Aviv after a close match in Israel, while Olympiakos will hope to avoid any surprise defeat in Cyprus as they protect their 2-0 lead away.

Ferencvaros and Molde played out an entertaining six goal thriller in which all goals were shared, while the first leg between FC Midtjylland and Slavia Prague ended goalless.

In the League Path, Dynamo Kiev will hope to preserve their 2-1 lead or even extend it at home after winning away at Gent, while PAOK Thessaloniki will seek to overturn their deficit at home after a 2-1 loss away at Krasnodar.

For a long time, they were the team of the Western Cape (thanks to Santos also getting relegated) so they had the pick of the talent in the province and with the link to Ajax Amsterdam which could've led to overseas playing opportunities, they were always going to get the cream of the available crop and this batch of rough diamonds, coupled with a good coach who could turn them into sparkling diamonds, put them in a good position to challenge for honors.

Their failure to continue challenging after their 2011 title push (they can thank Hans Vonk for fucking up in the last day) invariably led to a shift in focus from being a title challenger with developmental kids to being a feeder team. While it might not be widely spoken of, many players in the league want to join the Big 3 (Chiefs, Pirates &amp; Sundowns) for the glory/exposure/fame/money. It sucks for smaller clubs in the league but this is professional football and there is no place for sentimentality. Clubs are just as willing to toss players out when they lose their value so players need to ensure their financial safety one way or another and that road leads to Gauteng.

Even then, they got R12 Million for Rivaldo Coetzee (lol) and in the process, brought Tendai Ndoro on a free and promoted some youth players. Half that money is enough to bring in 4/5 players to reinforce the team but they (the Comitis and Efstathiou families) chose to stash it away.

By the time they woke up and realized that they were slipping, it was already too late as by then, Supersport and Wits took their spot as title challengers or more attractive options for players (Supersport and Wits offer better wages, are more successful, have more financial muscle and have their own academies), leading to an exodus of their talented players (both young and old) which forced them to become like every other club in the league and pick up disposed players from fellow competitors in the league.

I think another thing that might've killed them is as you said, the emergence of CTC to go along with the success of the Stormers and Cape Cobras. Fans can accept a team winning or losing as it gives the team the chance to see where they went wrong and improve. No one is gonna support a team if they are just treading water.Football is meant to be just as rewarding for us fans (emotionally speaking) as it is for the players (financially speaking) so if you have an owner that won't put money in, a team that plays uninspired football, a lifeless stadium that is already 1/10th filled, players who are ready to jump ship at the first decent offer and a shit manager, what's the point of following the team? Whether directly or indirectly, the success of these other cape based teams took the shine from them, leading to a dwindling support base leaving them less opportunity to make money out of the fans.&gt;

Ironically, the same two clubs that I touted has one selling its professional status and the other in serious financial trouble.
I don't think Ajax Amsterdam did utilize the partnership to its potential but even before the COVID crisis, I don't actually think South Africa is a profitable country to run a professional football league. With the national broadcaster bringing in international football and the interest of fans who still regularly watch the game invested in the the Big Three of S.A football (Chiefs, Pirates, and Sundowns), I just don't see the market or the lure for small teams.

Things are only going to get tougher for teams like Ajax (probably soon to be renamed Cape Town Spurs),and in provinces like the Western Cape where you've got Cape Town City as the only remaining Premiership club and the Glad Africa Championship where you've got teams fighting for survival (that grant money to sustain running a professional club), which fans or players are gonna want to stay there for a long term project?",1,honesti come gonna comment made year sentiment relev ever gt ultim think ajax result complac team western cape thank santo also releg talent provinc link ajax amsterdam could oversea opportun alway avail crop batch rough diamond coupl good coach could sparkl diamond put good challeng honor continu challeng push thank vonk day invari shift focu challeng development feeder team might wide spoken mani player leagu want chief sundown glori exposur fame smaller leagu profession footbal place sentiment player valu player need ensur financi safeti anoth road lead gauteng even million rivaldo coetze process brought tendai ndoro promot youth player half enough bring player reinforc team comiti efstathi famili chose stash away woke realiz slip alreadi supersport wit took challeng attract option player supersport wit offer better wage success financi academi lead exodu talent player young forc becom like everi leagu dispos player fellow competitor leagu think anoth thing might said emerg ctc along success stormer cape cobra accept team team chanc see wrong improv gonna support team tread water footbal meant reward emot speak player financi speak owner put team uninspir footbal lifeless stadium alreadi fill player readi jump first decent offer manag point follow team whether directli indirectli success cape base team took shine lead dwindl support base leav opportun make gt iron sell profession statu seriou financi troubl think ajax amsterdam util partnership potenti even covid crisi actual think south profit countri profession footbal leagu broadcast bring intern footbal interest still regularli watch game invest footbal chief sundown see market small team thing tougher team like ajax probabl soon renam cape town spur provinc like western cape cape town citi premiership glad championship team surviv grant sustain profession player gonna want stay term project

Ceba - Arsenal MVP. Comfortable and was bossing. 3-4 excellent chance created. 

Eleneny- Not the impactful player we want in mid. Two good long passes doesn't make up for his lack of press resistance, space creation, ball progression. No mistakes though. Recycler

Willian - Got more defensively involved later in the game. Offensively very poor. Like his replacement. 

Pepe- We have had many a games like this from him. Even when starting. Piss poor corners. Weak dribbling. 

Laca- Made that goal for us and himself. Doing his best from the limited service forwards are getting. Bad miss on that Ceba pass. 

Auba- Surprised to see him, not making runs against that high lines. I mean AMN was making more runs than him. Nothing to do the whole game but defend. 

AMN- And he is not having a good game.

"2020 Copa Libertadores, Group Stage (round 5/6): Brazilian teams - PREVIEW","From Tuesday 29th to Thursday 1st will happen the 5th Group Stage round of the 2020 Copa Libertadores. All times below are Brazil-set (GMT -3)

**Tuesday 29th, 7:15pm, Arena do Gr√™mio (Brazil)**

Gr√™mio/BRAZIL (2nd) vs. Universidad Cat√≥lica/CHILE (4th): the Brazilians have been having an awful season, with a lazy and uncompromised football. Gr√™mio fans are hoping the team will change the mindset in this encounter at home, instead of *keep pushing thing with their belly* as they have been doing. Keep an eye in Pep√™, the *""new Everton Cebolinha""*, in Gr√™mio side.

**Tuesday 29th, 9:30pm, Pascual Guerrero (Colombia)**

Am√©rica de Cali/COLOMBIA (3rd) vs. Internacional/BRAZIL (1st): it's a *live or die* match for the Colombians, who will play against a decaying Internacional. The Brazilians should be happy with a tie, while Am√©rica de Cali need a win to keep the hopes up in the cup.

**Tuesday 29th 9:30pm, Arena da Baixada (Brazil)**

Athletico/BRAZIL (1st) vs. Jorge Wilstermann/BOLIVIA (2nd): the Brazilians managed to beat the Bolivians 3-2 in the high altitude, so nothing but a victory is expected in Brazil. However, the weak performance of Athletico in the Brazilian League brings some doubts about their capacity to win.

**Wednesday 30th, 7:15pm, Allianz Parque (Brazil)**

Palmeiras/BRAZIL (1st) vs. Bol√≠var/BOLIVIA (3rd): Palmeiras are still undefeated in the Copa Libertadores, and managed to win Boliviar in the difficult altitude of Bolivia. Despite playing an ugly/defensive football, Palmeiras fans are expecting a solid win.

**Wednesday 30th, 9:30pm, Maracan√£ (Brazil)**

Flamengo/BRAZIL (2nd) vs. Independiente del Valle/ECUADOR (1st): a rematch after the 5-0 humilation suffered by Flamengo, now at home. However, the team was infested by Covid-19, with more than 20 players infected. It's a key match to Flamengo, who should play with their U20 and need a win in order to avoid the possibility of a *Maracanazzo* in the last round match.

**Wednesday 30th, 9:30pm, Avellaneda (Argentina)**

River Plate/ARGENTINA (2nd) vs. S√£o Paulo/BRAZIL (3rd): it's *Miracle Day* for S√£o Paulo, who need to beat the superior team of River Plate in Argentina, with an underperforming and decaying football. If S√£o Paulo don't win, they will be out of the Copa Libertadores, so get ready for a tense night.

**Thursday 1st, 7pm, Manuel Ferreira (Paraguay)**

Olimpia/PARAGUAY (3rd) vs. Santos/BRAZIL (1st): the Paraguayans need a win to keep their chances in the cup, while Santos are on a more comfortable situation. The last match between both teams was a boring 0-0, but hopes are high for a more cheerful match, given Olimpia situation and Santos offensive style.

We shouldn't let Dele leave because of our fixture congestion. If he gets back on form he'll definitely be in our starting lineup, but even if not he'll still get plenty of time in the cups and EL. We don't have a better number 10 than an in-form Dele, as GLC and Ndombele are both more comfortable deeper. Also what's the point of a loan if we're not even getting a big fee for him?

It doesn't make sense for PSG either. Dele is at his best as a second striker, playing right of the shoulder of a number 9. Assuming that's Icardi, than Neymar and Mbappe are already occupying those spaces behind him. PSG are very top-heavy anyway, and they have a lot of hard working midfielders like Gueye, Herrera, Parades etc. If they're looking for a playmaker to connect attack and midfield, that's not Dele. He's never really been too effective far away from goal, and PSG already have much better players than him closer to goal.

For Dele, he'll likely just move from one bench to another, but he'll go to a foreign city where he won't know the language, won't be with his mates, will face even tougher competition for spots and will not be adored by the fans like he is here.",1,move make sens liter none side imo dele leav fixtur congest form definit start lineup even still plenti cup better number form dele glc ndombel comfort deeper also point loan even fee make sens psg either dele second striker shoulder number assum icardi neymar mbapp alreadi occupi space behind psg top heavi anyway work midfield like guey herrera parad look playmak connect midfield dele never realli effect away goal psg alreadi much better player closer goal dele like move bench anoth foreign citi know languag even tougher competit ador like

Sometimes the referee reviews an action and then doesn't review a similar action for the other team. And for some reason the referees are using it to call penalty for every minor handball and that's unfair when there's no intention of actually touching the ball.

The last paragraph is the only one that adds some solid analysis IMO.

&gt; There also seems like a pretty clear connection in the uneven number of shots at both ends of the field and Arsenal‚Äôs inability to press. In the Arteta Era, the average uninterrupted possession in the Premier League has begun 46.7 meters from a team‚Äôs own goal. Liverpool‚Äôs average possession begins 52 meters away, and Manchester City‚Äôs starts 51 meters from their own net; no other team is north of 50. Arsenal, meanwhile, are way below average in terms of where they win the ball: 44.7 meters, ahead of only Wolves, Newcastle, Norwich, and two promoted sides (Leeds and West Brom). Better pressing, in theory, would create more opportunities on the attacking end *and* limit that limited amount of opposing possession from being turned into a disproportionate number of shots. To me, the defining question for the future of Arsenal is whether or not a shot-heavy, high-pressing approach can be eased into over time or whether it has to be instituted (with all the attendant growing pains) on Day One. 

I think that's a valid point of criticism. Arsenal don't seem to press or control space defensively especially well. From what I've seen their attacking movement is solid and they need to be more clinical, but they don't do an especially great job at pressing/disrupting the other team",1,major articl realli much worthwhil info imo mostli boil arsen gener defend well enough data prove better team paragraph solid analysi imo gt also seem like pretti clear connect uneven number field arsen inabl press arteta averag uninterrupt possess premier leagu begun team goal liverpool averag possess begin away manchest citi start team north arsen meanwhil averag term ahead wolv newcastl norwich promot side leed west brom better press theori would creat opportun limit limit amount oppos possess disproportion number defin question futur arsen whether heavi high press approach whether institut attend grow pain day think valid point critic arsen seem press control space defens especi well seen movement solid need clinic especi great press disrupt team

"An Introduction to Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla: ""The Redemption of Julen Lopetegui"""," Julen Lopetegui started coaching after a steady career as a goalkeeper. He finished his career at Rayo Vallecano. He became the assistant for Spain¬¥s U17 and in the same year; he was also a caretaker for Rayo Vallecano. This all took place in 2003. He wouldn‚Äôt coach actively before 2008, where he took over Real Madrid‚Äôs B side. His work at Real Madrid became the start of his illustrious coaching career. After one year at Real Madrid B, he would leave Madrid and take over Spain‚Äôs U19. It was here he demonstrated the incredible 4-3-3 formation, which would be his main formation. Spain was dominating national team football at the time, and Lopetegui was a part of the Spanish domination by winning UEFA European under-19 Championship in 2012 and UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 2013. He was coaching Spain¬¥s U19 from 2010 to 2013, and he also coached Spain U21 from 2012 to 2014. His testimony with the youth teams was unbelievable with the record of 26-5-1.

&amp;#x200B;

[üì∑Lopetegui and Thiago after winning the EC for U21. Thiago was also awarded the best player award.](https://preview.redd.it/b6j3o5f98vp51.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc25be37051356e9401f57a6cd49ee05692f66e)

After this spell, Lopetegui would join FC Porto in 2014. Porto had high expectation and gave Lopetegui all the resources to create an amazing squad. Lopetegui got the biggest budget in their club history. Lopetegui used this fund to sign seven Spanish players that summer (just an entertaining fact). His term at Porto was a rollercoaster with some highs and lows. After ending 3rd the league in his second season, it relieved him of his duties.

https://preview.redd.it/0gjve3yc8vp51.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=296a6db2490b8908e61f8b28ffa58e15b81cb5c3

Julen Lopetegui was the replacement for the legendary coach Vicente del Bosque, and Julen didn‚Äôt disappoint. Throughout his two years as the coach for Spain, Lopetegui would end unbeaten. His record with Spain was 14 wins, 6 draws, 0 loss. The Spanish FA sacked Lopetegui after Real Madrid announced he would be taking over at the Bernab√©u after the World Cup. All of this happened just before the World Cup which generated a lot of chaos. This situation caused him to pick up an enormous amount of spotlight when arriving at Real Madrid.

The chaos he established at Spain‚Äôs national team was following him to Madrid. He lost the locker room before starting, which was a significant issue for him. He couldn‚Äôt implement the structure at Real Madrid. They never displayed his vertical passing style football throughout his time there. Lopetegui and Real Madrid was a dreadful match. After just four and a half months, Lopetegui got fired from Real Madrid, having taken just 14 points from 30 available. After losing 5-1 to Barcelona at Camp Nou, Lopetegui would get fired. This made Lopetegui become the laughingstock of European football.

[A picture says more than a thousand words](https://preview.redd.it/xbq565ie8vp51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=852501bf1aac4a799f3f0601f00cd3899c584b1d)

The redemption arc for Julen Lopetegui started after Sevilla on 5 June 2019 appointed him as the manager. They even granted him a 3-year contract. This was a huge play from Monchi. He was clear which type of coach that should take over after Joaquin Caparros departure. Monchi wanted a coach that ‚Äúwhen we have the ball it takes a long time to lose it and when we lose it, we recover it quickly‚Äù. Monchi envisioned a Sevilla dominating the ball and could regroup quickly. Lopetegui was the perfect coach to help Monchi‚Äôs vision.

Monchi made several new signing and rebranded Sevilla. Most of the players were talented young players or players other teams had given up on. Also, the Sevilla team the year before got dismantled with players like Ben Yedder (wow he would be perfect as the striker for Lopetegui), Luis Muriel (wow he would be perfect as the striker for Lopetegui), Promes, Nolito, Sergio Rico, etc.

[The Dream Team](https://preview.redd.it/cexxtg8h8vp51.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19b16e7fb1862528cc4f0801d779ab71a30014d2)

The simplest way to demonstrate how different the team Lopetegui‚Äôs team was compared to the year before is through the picture below.

[We can even add De Jong and En-Nesyri](https://preview.redd.it/0fx0y9lj8vp51.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aac4ce994ccf5ed6f45e053b82df0a260550c894)

As you can see, there are 8 new players in their starting lineup, which is a massive change. Also, Sevilla‚Äôs most costly purchase was the most unsuccessful transfer until now. Rony Lopes was the only transfer that didn‚Äôt breakthrough in this team, while Ocampos has broken through to stardom. Looking at the formation, we can understand how Lopetegui‚Äôs team classically will set his team up.

In his year as Sevilla boss, Lopetegui changed the playing style Sevilla had to follow Monchi‚Äôs view. He even implemented some additional aspects to his tactics, like forcing verticalization and playing with a lower defensive line. These elements helped him achieve domination of the ball and being quick to regroup. Lopetegui started the season struggling because the team hadn‚Äôt yet learned his system and the execution of the system was not fluid. In his first 8 games as the coach for Sevilla, Sevilla would lose 3 games. After this struggle, Sevilla would play fantastic football, Lopetegui regained his reputation throughout the season. They were still not efficient enough on their chances, and this reminded me of Sarri‚Äôs Napoli at the start of his stint. I think Sarri and Lopetegui have many elements of their tactics in common, which I will go in depth within the tactical analysis.

[Ocampos break to stardom happened under Lopetegui.](https://preview.redd.it/th986ljm8vp51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df52963d17b0bae185c755f8eb05e6b512f5e5e5)

Their ineffectiveness gave them a lot of ties, and this was the reason they finished on the same point tally as Atletico Madrid while playing better football throughout the season. Lopetegui‚Äôs side went on an unbeaten run from the 25th round of La Liga to the end of the season, and the run ended after the Bayern Munich game.

Sevilla achieved a fourth place in LaLiga Santander and also won the Europa League. Everything in this season went Lopetastic. Lopetegui ended up with only losing 8 games of Sevilla‚Äôs 54 games in all competitions. This success even surprised Monchi, who was amazed at how Lopetegui always demand more of his players, even though they were winning. The star player of their season, Ever Banega, even thanked Lopetegui in his farewell speech. It‚Äôs obvious that the squad and the club have adopted his philosophy and it has become their identity, just after one season. It‚Äôs truly Lopetastic.

But how does Lopetegui play, why does this work so well with Sevilla? Lopetegui organises his side in a 4-3-3 formation with a vertical passing style. A vertical passing style is a passing style that concentrates on playing direct (vertical) passes, which is also the primary focus for Lopetegui. The immense advantage of adopting this style is the instant progression of the ball into a more advanced area of the pitch. Monchi‚Äôs ideas perfectly illustrated with their structure and their possession game was 3rd in La Liga (55,9%).

[Bono looks like the starting goalkeeper\*](https://preview.redd.it/jjaks35p8vp51.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8751443d1816afc32fdba61f9b452f9cfea290)

Lopetegui's philosophy or Lopetism includes the mentality of not having stars players and the most important aspect is the execution of the gameplan, which is very comparable to Sarri before joining Juventus. Lopetism also wants to include Spanish culture everywhere it¬¥s applied. Lopetegui even brought seven Spanish players to Porto, which is the best example. Lopetegui¬¥s philosophy adopts adaptability, which makes them more flexible tactically, throughout games. Lopetegui uses 4-2-3-1 when he wants to defend more and uses 3-5-2 formation when he wants to attack more.Their pressuring game is not super aggressive but is clever. The striker will pressure the CBs while the wingers cut the passing lanes. Last, the midfielders try to get as tight as possible to their opponent.

Their defensive structure is like Spain‚Äôs side under del Bosque. Sevilla starts their build-ups from the back to control the velocity of the game. When they are in possession, will they shape into a 3-4-3 formation, because the full-backs rushing forward, while Fernando/Gudelj drop to the CB when they start the build-up. This will make Kounde and Carlos wide the pitch out to create several options for their teammates, which generates a fluid build-up. Fernando/Gudelj presence at the start of the build-up is vital in this phase. It also makes it more complex for the opponent to produce a counter when they apply this build-up.

Sevilla defends in a 4-1-4-1 formation, but it‚Äôs kind of asymmetric because Suso drops to midfield more than Ocampos. Ocampos instead is waiting on the counter. Fernando would either work between the midfield and the defence or drop to the CBs (rarely happens). Their defensive line uses a typical zonal defence and their center backs are playing close together, even though their fullbacks are playing wide on the pitch. This creates a considerable area between the CB and FB, they do this on purpose. They use this as bait, so they can regain possession faster. They can do this because their CBs are fast.

The most interesting part of the team is by far their midfield. It‚Äôs because it is very atypical. They play with a DM and two CM, that keep shape all the time on offence. Also, it‚Äôs centralized and operates like a unit. The most atypical feature of this midfield is the absence of movement, is always drifting forward and drifting backwards. The downside of this midfield is when they are playing a side that is playing with a 4-3-3 formation because it reduces the attacking threat of the full-backs because the expectation to give cover at the back. Banega (largely) and Jordan have been in charge of organizing the attack. Identify when to play short or long, timing both in the offensive phase and in the defensive phase. The shape causes that the opponent needs to play the ball width because it‚Äôs tough breaking down this shape. Many teams still try to break through it and Sevilla cutting the passing lanes, which produce the half counters. These half counters are deadly.

https://preview.redd.it/aysgsjqr8vp51.png?width=1343&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9554b42b9e9d817476e5576eb9ae061f5ef9d3c3

The most noticeable feature for Sevilla is by far the attacking fullbacks acting like wingbacks. The wingbacks provide the width to generate more passing options. Sevilla when building up will get the ball to the wingbacks as fast as they can. The wingbacks will hardly cut inside. Their partners in crime are acting as inverted wingers, which the total opposite of what the wingbacks do. The wingbacks will constantly overlap because of this, while the inverted wingers will either overwhelm the box or operate just outside the box (Suso). Ocampos will sometimes also develop into a secondary striker to overwhelm the box, which has been rather successful. Suso will have a more free role and operate all over the place. Suso sometimes falls between the lines, which most of the times create space for Jes√∫s Navas to get in behind the defence.

https://preview.redd.it/j6go22vs8vp51.png?width=1397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=693a2187c7a55e073c7a73b74908e682ba7baf41

Lopetegui‚Äôs weakest position is the striker. The striker has a lot of freedom to do what they are best at. They have used two strikers this season in En-Nesyri and De Jong. En-Nesyri is a more movable box player that provides a remarkable effort when pressing, but inefficient while De Jong is a classic target man. This is unquestionably the area where a top striker would make this team incredible because the entire team is trying the create for the striker.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/j19l26/video/5nqpn7iu8vp51/player

Sevilla is going into a highly interesting season. Sevilla is just one goalscorer away from being a contender for the La Liga title, in my opinion. They have the structure to amaze everyone this season, but the lack of a goalscorer is killing them. Sevilla has over the transfer window purchased Oscar, Acuna and Rakitic, while Banega, Reguilon and Sergio Rico have left the club. Oscar is the big wildcard this season because he can provide a lot of creativity and will add dynamic into their midfield. Rakitic and Acuna will be replacements for Reguilon and Banega.

https://preview.redd.it/47ez0ruw8vp51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a963bbc589d9bf5754b1a2dcd4fdab0b66b25f9

Lopetegui aspires to carry out an improved version of Sevilla going into the season. Lopetegui has found out they are getting too many draws against poor sides. The tweak Lopetegui wants to apply is the 3-5-2 formation. As diariodesevilla.es pointed out, Sevilla played this formation in the second half against Levante, and this is all carried out to implement Oscar in a more advanced position when they desire to get the victory against less superior sides. They use this formation to get the most out of his players in situations where they struggle against poor sides. The 3-5-2 formation is very offensive but isn‚Äôt as direct in their passing style.

https://preview.redd.it/nzmnasox8vp51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb31714c5f9ac10602858388196229292a0dff4

Lopetegui said, ‚ÄúThere are other games in which the plan is to be a little more direct. It depends on the rival, on your players. Sometimes it is controlling the second play and sometimes is having a lot of widths and a lot of depth with the control of the ball‚Äù.

He has adopted this formation before at Porto and Spain. When he applied this formation in Spain, Isco was unlocked and played the finest football of his career. I don‚Äôt think we will see Lopetegui use this formation to start games, instead, it‚Äôs a formation they can adjust to when Lopetegui finds it fit. Lopetegui‚Äôs Sevilla is one of the most exciting teams this season, and their performance against Bayern Munich was a remarkable example of why I think they are one good goalscorer from contention for La Liga title.

"Each week, I do a deep-dive into the business of football. This week, I wrote on Elliott Management and their ongoing business relationship with AC Milan.","On 16th December 1899, Nottingham-born footballer Herbert Kiplin founded Italian giants AC Milan. ‚ÄúWe will be a team of devils‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúOur colors will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents‚Äù. 

Over the past few years now, AC Milan has been a shadow of its former self, having won the Serie A way back in 2011. It‚Äôs been 9 years now and the Rossoneri is still struggling to compete with Europe‚Äôs finest. 

At the forefront to change the fortunes of the fallen Italian giant is another giant - American investment management firm Elliott Management. Founded in 1977 by Paul Singer after borrowing $1.3 million from friends and family, the Elliott Corporation is now worth $35 billion.

Elliott Management has a kind of cult status in the investing world, with some calling it ‚Äúthe vulture fund‚Äù, and for good reason. A vulture fund is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. 

This is exactly the kind of situation in which Paul Singer and Elliott Management swooped in to take-over the Milan-based club. 

In April 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong acquired AC Milan for ‚Ç¨740m from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs investment firm Fininvest, ending his two-decade-long tenure at the club. This acquisition was completed by Yonghong via Rossoneri Sports Investment Luxembourg, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created to acquire the Italian giants.  

Yonghong had big hopes for the club. Part of his strategy was to leverage the club‚Äôs massive Chinese fan base and reshape the financial and organizational structure of the club. To execute his vision, Yonghong borrowed loans worth almost ‚Ç¨300m from Elliott Management with an interest rate of ~11%. 

A little over a year later in July 2018, Yonghong could not repay his debts losing around ‚Ç¨500m in equity, effectively ending his brief stint at the club. Elliott swooped in, acquiring 99.93% of the stakes of AC Milan for ‚Ç¨400m, half of what it was valued at just a few months earlier. 

**Project Milan 2.0**

Elliott had a clear strategy for the club - raise the value of the club by winning matches on the pitch, make revenue off it, and sell for a healthy return. Over the past decade, the club‚Äôs annual revenues have hovered around the ‚Ç¨200m mark. 

For perspective, Juventus‚Äô annual return for the 2018-19 season was ‚Ç¨494m. This is ‚Ç¨94m more than what Elliott bought the entire club for. To solve this problem, the hedge fund first injected a sum of ‚Ç¨50m into AC Milan to shore up the club‚Äôs balance sheets.

Elliott also appointed former Arsenal Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis as AC Milan‚Äôs new Chief Executive. It also brought in two more important people to the club. Club legend Paolo Maldini was brought in as Technical Director and Italian businessman Paolo Scaroni was brought in as Chairman. 

To scout players, former Arsenal executive, and LSE alumni Henrik Almstadt was tasked with identifying transfers. So was former AS Monaco head scout Geoffrey Moncada. 

Another company that played a part in the Milan takeover by Elliott Management is the private investment group, Blue Skye. Founded by Napoli-based businessmen Salvatore Cerchione and Gianluca D'Avanzo, the two are board members at the Rossoneri, with D‚ÄôAvanzo the Chief Financial Officer of the club. 

Both founders have had a long-standing relationship with former AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. All three of them were on the board of SOPAF - a private equity firm that owned 50% of Blue Skye until 2006. They later sold these shares to another hedge fund DB Zwirn. 

On March 20, 2017, Blue Skye played its first part in the Li Hongyong takeover when it took control of the Luxembourg Investment Company - the entity that lent the money to Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux, Hongyong‚Äôs SPV. On April 4, 2017, the Luxembourg Investment Company changed its name to Project Redblack. 

On April 10, 2017, Blue Skye ceded control of Project Redblack to two SPVs owned by Elliott management, King George and Genio, in Delaware. Once Elliott gained control of AC Milan, Blue Skye was given a small piece of the AC Milan pie. 

**What now for Milan**

For the 2018-19 season, the first under Elliott management, AC Milan suffered the worst result in the club‚Äôs history with its loss before tax amount increasing from ‚Ç¨121m to ‚Ç¨143m.

Unsurprisingly, this was also the worst in Serie A by some margin. For perspective, Inter had a total pre-loss amount of ‚Ç¨40m and champions Juventus with ‚Ç¨27m. The highest profit margin was reported by Atalanta who made ‚Ç¨35m while also qualifying for the Champions League. 

One of the reasons for Milan‚Äôs poor numbers is the steep decline in profit on player sales - with the number falling a whopping ‚Ç¨23m from ‚Ç¨35m to ‚Ç¨12m. For perspective, Juventus generated profits worth almost 10x more with ‚Ç¨127m. 

In general, Milan has struggled with earning profits on player sales earning an average of ‚Ç¨11m profit a year since 2014. In the same time period, Juventus have made a profit of ‚Ç¨417m, Roma ‚Ç¨391m, and Inter ‚Ç¨185m. 

Despite Milan‚Äôs revenue rising 4% from ‚Ç¨220m to ‚Ç¨228m, it‚Äôs still less than half of Juventus who reported revenues worth ‚Ç¨494m and ‚Ç¨150m less than Inter‚Äôs ‚Ç¨370m. They are ahead of Napoli though, who reported revenues worth ‚Ç¨207m. 

However, things might be turning around for AC Milan. For instance, in the season recently completed (2019-20), Milan reduced their losses from ‚Ç¨143m to ‚Ç¨100m. Of these losses, ‚Ç¨20m is directly attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Unlike other clubs in Serie A, the Rossoneri have no debt on the bond markets or from banks. For comparison, Juventus, Inter, and AS Roma have taken credits or issued bonds worth over ‚Ç¨300m. 

This means that Milan is not answerable to any external investors or institutions. Its assets can also be easily liquidated as 100% of its shares can be sold for cash. Add to that its zero-debt, and Milan certainly appears a promising prospect for investors and sponsors. 

Plus the Zlatan effect isn‚Äôt too bad either. 

Could the Elliott formula be working?

Taking Liverpool as a case study, what Ive realised that there are 3 components for any club to drive forward.

Football/ Sports Director - Someone who runs the footballing side on a day to day basis so the manager can focus his attentions to only playing football &amp; winning on the pitch. ofcourse there are many caveats to this role like a strong scouting, data-science to determine hidden gems players statistically &amp; great football acumen to determine a players worth either buying or selling

CEO/ Director - Someone to lead the club forward off football leaving the Sports director &amp; manager to focus on sporting activity. He plays the most crucial role determining club finances from commercial perspective. Hes the difference between affording Sancho or Sarr.

Manager- The glue that holds the club together. Without the right man to buy into the philosophy of both the club &amp; management it all falls apart. 

Milan structurally are in the right place. Its just about appointing the right men at the right places. 

In my opinion they blundered by not get Ragnick &amp; keeping Maldini. While Maldini might prove his worth over the course of time what Milan needed right now was Ragnick. Also their manager seems iffy at best.

,,"Not even the Covid-19 pandemic was able to delay the 'super agent', proof of this are the five deals in the space of a month, with four Portuguese players and one Argentine player who earned Jorge Mendes 19.7 million euros, based on 10% that the agent receives for each deal.

R√∫ben Dias' most recent transfer is proof that Jorge Mendes, at best, reinforced his influence in the world of football after the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the weaknesses of the king's sport. The early departure of the SL Benfica Champions League forced the club to sell, and the deal that promoted the return of Nicolas Otamendi, ex-FC Porto, to Portugal was quickly concluded, allowing a fit to the 'incarnates' of 68 million. fundamental euros for the accounts of the 'incarnates', plus an experienced player and important for the strategy of Jorge Jesus.

With this deal and, assuming that Jorge Mendes will receive 10% of both deals, the 'superagent' will invest 6.8 million euros from R√∫ben Dias and another 1.5 million euros from the business of Argentine Nicol√°s Otamendi .

These businesses are joined by the two Portuguese who joined Wolverhampton FC, a team that has been a regular customer of Jorge Mendes, Nelson Semedo (30 million euros) and F√°bio Silva (40 million euros), of whom the owner of Gestifute will receive three and four million euros respectively. Finally, the arrival of Portuguese international, Diogo J., to English champion Liverpool FC for 44.7 million euros, may have earned Jorge Mendes 4.4 million euros.

Eight days before the transfer window closes in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany and 18 days before closing in England, it is to be expected that some more moves will happen. With the Gestifute portfolio, this transfer window can have a very positive impact on the player agency and, especially, on Jorge Mendes.",1,even covid pandem delay super agent proof five deal space month portugues player argentin player earn jorg mend million base agent receiv deal recent transfer proof jorg mend reinforc influenc world footbal covid pandem expos weak sport earli departur benfica champion leagu forc sell deal promot return nicola otamendi porto portug quickli conclud incarn million fundament account incarn experienc player import strategi jorg deal assum jorg mend receiv deal superag invest million anoth million busi argentin nicol otamendi busi portugues wolverhampton team regular custom jorg mend nelson semedo million bio silva million owner gestifut receiv million respect final arriv portugues intern diogo english champion liverpool million may earn jorg mend million eight day transfer window close portug spain germani day close england expect move gestifut portfolio transfer window impact player agenc especi jorg mend

The overall absurd quality of the squad will help City do well enough this season, but the teams around them seem like they've pretty much figured out how to play against a Pep team.

,,"Hindsight is a wonderful thing but as soon as it was clear that Leicester were going to sit into two banks of 5 then Rodri should‚Äôve been pulled for a another attacker; I‚Äôd say Feran considering their poor options. 

Dropping KDB a bit deeper, moving Foden more central and having Feran Torres on the left would have made them so much more unpredictable. Trying to stretch the spaces between defenders, when they‚Äôre parked, is so important and having Feran and Mahrez on the wings would‚Äôve allowed that more. Rodri and Fernandinho as a double pivot which is basically operating just off the oppositions box is painfully dull. 

Obviously removing one of the more defensive mids exposes them, in theory, to counters more; but they were exposed with them. Having a more attacking lineup and increasing the chance of scoring offsets the risk of conceding counters.

# Appetizers

* In a match that won't stay long in people's memory, Lille logically beat Nantes 2-0 at home, with the first goal from Burak Yilmaz and an own goal from Nicolas Pallois. The nordists are still one of the two teams unbeaten in the league and while they're not as well oiled offensively as last year, they are extremely consistent, an asset that not a lot of teams own.
* The big match. The event the world turned on the TV to watch. Saint-√âtienne-Rennes. Well, that was a beating. Les Verts suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the bretons. Guirassy scored his third goal since his arrival, Aguerd proved again how good a recruit he was and Hunou, Rennes' very own Solksjaer, closed the debate for good. Saint-√âtienne was dominated the whole match. Obviously the Fofana situation didn't help but it can't be the only explanation. Rennes is just the better team.
* Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, Metz concedes a late goal. For the third time this season in only five games, Metz lost precious points in the last five minutes. After a loss in Lille at the 88th minute, another in Paris at the 93rd, this time it was Marseille that equalized at the 95th with Morgan Sanson finishing a brilliant sequence. Those late goals represent already four points and for a team that will fight to avoid relegation it's already quite a lot. Marseille on the other hand continues to play like those are summer friendlies but gets rewarded somehow. Still, it's the third match without a win for the phoceans.
* After taking no points in four matches, Dijon was that close from getting three at once against the ever struggling away from home Montpellier. Unfortunately, a foul from Panzo on Delort (who scored earlier on a great cross from Laborde) on the last minute allowed T√©ji Savanier to equalize.
* Monaco continues their tradition of getting red cards left and right (2 in this match, 13 since the start of the last season). Fortunately, they have become competent at football again. Besides the loss against Rennes last week, Monaco have't conceded any defeat this season, winning 3 and drawing once while dominating their opponents most of the time. Ben Yedder scored twice, Aguilar being the other scorer for Monaco. Strasbourg relied on Chahiri and a penalty from Ajorque to keep the pressure on the men from le Rocher. That wasn't enough.
* Lyon didn't manage to beat Lorient despite having the ball 70% of the time. At one point it was even looking like they would not get any point at all after Hamel got himself strangely alone then sent the ball to Wissa who put it right under the bar. But ten minutes later, the french international L√©o Dubois equalized on a Robben-like goal perfectly executed. That won't satisfy anyone in the club as Lyon concedes their 4th match in a row without a win, just like Lorient by the way, but obviously the ambition from both clubs are slightly different.
* Getting to face PSG during a period of doubt is not the greatest gift you could ask. After being eliminated in Europa League qualifiers at the hands of the juggernaut MOL Feh√©rvar, Reims hosted the european vice-champion on sunday night and while they held their ground as they usually do against Paris, the talent on the other side was too much to contain. Mauro Icardi finally awakened and scored a brace after seven months without a goal. Granted Paris didn't play four months but still, it was getting seriously worrying. The score could have been far greater if not for a top performance from Rajkovic. Business as usual.

### [](#sprite2-p108) The Toulouse Corner

In a world that has turned upside down in 2020 we saw Australia ravaged by fires (well more than usual should I say), a pangolin destroy the world economy, PSG not choking in Champions League and even frenchmen winning Grands Prix in MotoGP and Formula 1, as well as becoming world champion in cycling. We saw Rennes becoming a consistent and threatening team, Lyon being out of Europe for the first time in this millennium and Reims returning on the continental stage for the first time in almost 60 years. But amongst this weirdness, we could at least hold on a beacon of consistency : Toulouse's incapacity to win.

However, this last rampart separating us from the underworld has shattered on saturday as the Violets beat Auxerre at home 3-1. Their first in 332 days (11 months). And if that wasn't proof enough that our journey towards armageddon is coming to an end, they did it after being down 1-0 and scoring all three goals in 25 minutes. Ironically it was also the first time they played without an audience. Now should we believe there is a cause and effect link ? Every theory can be heard now.

With this win, Toulouse gets out of the relegation zone, replaced by another southwestern team : Pau, while Ajaccio is stuck at the bottom of the league (though they have a postponed match to play against Dunkerque because of COVID-19). On the other side, Niort has settled at the top, having not lost a game since the start of the season. Under the Chamois, Paris FC continues to be in the battle for the promotion despite some hiccups in the last few games. Meanwhile, Amiens fired their coach Luka Elsner after a poor 0-0 against Pau.

### [](#icon-discuss-big) Quotes

Julien St√©phan, Rennes coach :
&gt;The ranking remains anecdotal but not the performance. It is a successful match on our part. We played the match we wanted. I liked the general balance of the team, the collective control, the courage we showed, the performance of our midfield, the ability to defend together and to get the balls out after recovery.

Morgan Sanson, Marseille midfielder :
&gt;It's been complicated. We felt like we were managing the first half. We had possession of the ball. After the first goal, we slept a little, I don't know what we do, we don't have the ball. And we are lucky, we manage to equalize but it is complicated. We can't manage to get from the goalkeeper to the opposing goal by combining or just a little bit from time to time.

St√©phane Jobard, Dijon coach :
&gt;The victory was stolen from my players who should have been rewarded. We are frustrated. It's the feeling that comes first. I saw the footage of the penalty kick again, I also went to see the referee who told me that my defender was holding the opponent for four to five seconds! That sounds like a lot. It's always easier to whistle against Dijon. [...] We're in a tough situation (only one point taken out of fifteen possible) but my players managed to produce some play. I'm still waiting for attackers at the end of the mercato it can be interesting to bring in some fresh blood.

Niko Kovac, Monaco coach :
&gt;My players were heroic! Playing with nine players, the youngsters who came in showed a lot of character! In French, we say: chapeau! But it's not better to win with nine players because next time we'll be missing two. We continue to learn and grow little by little. We made some small mistakes. This is part of youth development. Four from the training centre played today. This is our goal. They were under a lot of pressure. They responded well.

St√©phane Moulin, Angers coach :
&gt;We made a disastrous start and the Brestois took advantage of it. We came back, but after the second goal, we lost the pedals. That's where the game is played because they didn't take advantage of their chances and because we have a great goalkeeper. At half-time we had to shake the coconut tree. Because before the break, apart from the technical shortcomings, there were also shortcomings in terms of investment. For the first time of the season, I raised the voice. There was a change of players, a change of system because we had to shake things up.

[Jean-Marc Furlan, Auxerre coach](https://streamable.com/6jsgvw) :
&gt;Losing against Toulouse who hadn't won for almost a year, we don't give a fuck*. This stat, it makes you excited, it gives erections to the journalists, same for the supporters.

\* (literally ""on s'en bat les couilles grave"" =&gt; ""we beat our own balls"")

/u/abedtime, recycler-in-chief :
&gt;The contrast between Lyon-Lorient and Leicester-Manchester City is excellent. The Premier League is an action movie, a big blockbuster a bit stupid but with a lot of pace whereas Ligue 1 is a film d'auteur where few things happen but the subtleties are pleasant.

Football: Premier League has a month to decide on any handball law change request,,,1,footbal premier leagu month decid handbal law chang request
,,"I don't know why these posts keep getting upvoted. The Premier League can't unilaterally change the laws, the handball law is going to be reviewed by the IFAB no matter what as it is every year.

However, the Premier League can decide on the interpretation of the laws up to a point, which it can do at any time.

I've seen so many arbitrary deadlines thrown around of when things can and can't be changed by. This article seems to be about the deadline for making a request to the IFAB for a law change, which isn't going to stop them discussing a controversial existing law and is more about trialling brand new ideas. For example, if the Premier League wanted to trial kick-ins rather than throw-ins they'd need a law change so would request it in November. There's no way the IFAB will just ignore the handball law if nobody has formally mentioned it by November.",1,know post keep upvot premier leagu unilater chang law handbal law review ifab matter everi year howev premier leagu decid interpret law point seen mani arbitrari deadlin thrown around thing chang articl seem deadlin make request ifab law chang stop discuss controversi exist law triall brand new exampl premier leagu want trial kick rather throw need law chang would request novemb ifab ignor handbal law nobodi formal mention novemb
